# Underground Rough-In Checklist

Below is a detailed, step-by-step checklist for the Underground Rough-In phase. This document expands on the brief list found in `schema.json`, providing more context for apprentices and installers.

## 1. Pre-Trench Preparation

1. **Obtain and Review Documents**  
   - Site plans, electrical one-line diagrams, utility maps.  
   - Look for any special instructions regarding conduit types, minimum cover, or specific local code amendments.

2. **Utility Locates**  
   - Call 811 (or equivalent service) to identify existing utilities.  
   - Mark all known water, sewer, gas, fiber, or power lines before excavation.

3. **Tool & Material Verification**  
   - Ensure you have the correct conduit type (PVC, RMC, etc.) and sizes.  
   - Check you have expansion fittings, couplings, elbows, and adhesives (for PVC).  
   - Gather grounding materials (rods, clamps, grounding conductor).

## 2. Layout and Excavation

1. **Mark Trenches**  
   - Use stakes, paint, or flags to mark trench path per approved drawings.  
   - Verify alignment with general contractor or site superintendent.

2. **Excavation**  
   - Use proper equipment (trenchers, excavators) with experienced operators.  
   - Confirm depth and width meet or exceed NEC 300.5 requirements and engineer’s specs.  
   - Dispose of spoils (excavated soil) in approved areas; stockpile or haul away as needed.

3. **Trench Safety**  
   - Slope or shore sides of the trench if deeper than 5 ft (per OSHA requirements).  
   - Use ladder access if the trench is deeper than 4 ft and workers must enter.

## 3. Conduit and Duct Bank Placement

1. **Bedding Layer**  
   - Place sand or gravel bedding at the bottom of the trench if specified.  
   - Ensure a level base to support conduits or duct banks.

2. **Conduit Assembly**  
   - Lay out PVC or RMC sections along the trench.  
   - Use approved solvent cement for PVC or correct threading couplings for RMC.  
   - Maintain recommended spacing between multiple conduits per project drawings to prevent thermal interference.  
   - Install expansion fittings where indicated (e.g., crossing structural expansion joints).

3. **Sweeps and Elbows**  
   - Use large-radius elbows where cables will be pulled to reduce stress.  
   - Keep transitions smooth and avoid unnecessary bends.

## 4. Grounding and Bonding

1. **Ground Rod Installation**  
   - Drive rods at specified locations or place them in a rod-driven or excavated hole.  
   - Ensure top of rod is below grade or in an accessible vault.  
   - Bond rods to the system ground using listed connectors.

2. **Ufer Ground (If Specified)**  
   - Coordinate with concrete contractor if using a concrete-encased electrode.  
   - Confirm rebar continuity and bonding if rebar is used as the electrode.

3. **Conduit Bonding**  
   - Ensure metal conduits are bonded per NEC 250 requirements.  
   - Use grounding bushings or bonding jumpers around expansion fittings if required.

## 5. Inspection & Backfill

1. **Inspection**  
   - Notify the AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) or city inspector once conduits and grounding are placed.  
   - Provide open access to trench for verification of depth, spacing, and general compliance.

2. **Backfill Process**  
   - Place initial backfill in 6-12 inch lifts, free of large rocks or debris.  
   - Compact each lift to avoid settling.  
   - Continue until trench is filled to finished grade.

3. **Final Surface**  
   - If under pavement or slab, coordinate with civil or concrete crews for final pour.  
   - Ensure accurate location records or “as-built” updates for future reference.

## 6. Documentation & As-Builts

1. **Labeling**  
   - Mark conduits at stub-ups or pull boxes with circuit IDs.  
   - If required, color-code or use permanent tags for quick identification.

2. **Record Keeping**  
   - Update as-built drawings with exact conduit paths, depths, and pull box locations.  
   - Note any field changes or deviations from the original plan.

3. **Final Sign-Off**  
   - Secure inspector’s approval.  
   - Communicate completion to the project manager or general contractor.

## 7. Completion

- Double-check that all items are done or documented before moving to the next phase.  
- Clean up the work area, remove excess materials, and return tools to storage.

**Important**: Always comply with the **current NEC** and **local amendments**. Safety is paramount—follow all **OSHA** guidelines for trenching and electrical work.
