# Materials for Underground Rough-In

Below is a detailed list of commonly used materials, their typical specifications, and notes on usage. Actual project requirements may differ based on engineering design, local amendments, or specific customer requests.

## Conduits and Fittings

1. **PVC Conduit (Schedule 40 or 80)**
   - **Usage**: Most common for underground installations due to corrosion resistance and ease of assembly.
   - **Typical Sizes**: 2" – 4" diameter for feeders; can vary for branch circuits.
   - **Notes**: Use PVC cement approved for electrical conduit. Some jurisdictions require Schedule 80 for areas subject to physical damage.

2. **Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC) or Intermediate Metal Conduit (IMC)**
   - **Usage**: Certain specs may require metal conduit for added mechanical protection.
   - **Typical Sizes**: 2" – 4", depending on current-carrying requirements.
   - **Notes**: Ensure proper anti-corrosion coatings or wraps if in contact with soil.

3. **Expansion Fittings**
   - **Usage**: Installed where significant temperature changes or structural movement is expected.
   - **Notes**: Must be sized to match conduit OD; ensure you bond around metal expansion fittings if they are not self-grounding.

4. **Elbows, Couplings, and Adapters**
   - **Usage**: Sweep elbows (large radius) for easy cable pulling; couplings to join conduit sections.
   - **Notes**: For PVC, use appropriate primer (where required) and cement per manufacturer instructions.

## Grounding Components

1. **Ground Rods**
   - **Specification**: 5/8" x 8' copper-bonded steel rods are common.
   - **Notes**: Length and diameter may vary per local codes or design (e.g., 10 ft rods or stainless rods in corrosive soils).

2. **Grounding Conductors**
   - **Size**: Often #4 AWG for large commercial services, but design may call for #6 or larger wire.
   - **Type**: Copper wire; might be bare or green insulated, depending on the engineer’s specification.

3. **Ground Clamps or Mechanical Connectors**
   - **Usage**: Connect ground rods or rebar to the grounding conductor.
   - **Notes**: Must be listed for direct burial or concrete-encased use.

## Pull Boxes, Vaults, and Handholes

1. **Pull Boxes / Handholes**
   - **Material**: Precast concrete, polymer concrete, or fiberglass.
   - **Size**: Typically range from 12" x 12" x 12" up to 36" x 36" x 36" or larger.
   - **Usage**: Required for long conduit runs, large conductor pulls, or changes in direction to reduce pulling tension.

2. **Vaults**
   - **Usage**: Larger enclosures, sometimes manhole-sized, used for high-capacity feeders or substation-level conductors.
   - **Notes**: May require confined space entry protocols if large enough for a worker to enter.

## Backfill and Bedding

1. **Bedding Material (Sand/Gravel)**
   - **Usage**: Provides stable, rock-free base around conduits.
   - **Notes**: Typically placed 3–6 inches below the conduit and then 6 inches above.

2. **Select Fill or Native Soil**
   - **Usage**: Used to fill trenches above the bedding layer.
   - **Notes**: Must be free of large rocks or debris that could damage conduit.

## Other Accessories

1. **Detectable Marking Tape**
   - **Usage**: Buried above conduits to warn future excavators of electrical lines.
   - **Notes**: Commonly installed 12–18 inches below finished grade.

2. **Spacers or Saddles**
   - **Usage**: Maintain uniform spacing in duct banks.
   - **Notes**: Typically plastic or metallic. Ensures alignment for multi-conduit runs.

3. **Labels or Tags**
   - **Usage**: Mark conduit ends or vault entries with circuit identification or system references.
   - **Notes**: Some sites use color-coded tape or heat-shrink labels.

## Quantity Estimation

- **PVC Conduit**: Usually estimated in linear feet (LF). For every 100 feet of trench, you may need 100 feet of conduit per run. Multiply by the number of runs.  
- **Elbows & Fittings**: Approx. 1–2 per 100 ft for standard directional changes; plan extra for future expansions or field modifications.  
- **Grounding Rods**: Typically 1–2 rods per service or per project design; large sites might need more.  
- **Pull Boxes**: 1 box every 100–200 feet or at 90° turns, as recommended by design specs.

**Important**: Always verify exact material specs in the project drawings and local code amendments. The above list is a general reference.
