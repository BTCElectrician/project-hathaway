    "Use current limiting devices or faster trip settings where possible to reduce arc flash energy. For instance, zone-selective interlocking (ZSI) on the ground-fault or other protection can reduce clearing time for faults, lowering arc energy.",
    "Ensure all workers understand arc flash boundaries: the approach limits and the requirement to wear appropriate PPE within those boundaries. Establish a habit that nobody opens an energized panel or switches gear without proper arc flash gear and a risk assessment briefing.",
    "During commissioning, perform infrared scanning (thermography) on the main connections under load (once energized) to check for hot spots, which can indicate loose connections that could lead to faults or arc flash events if not corrected.",
    "Include arc flash and electrical emergency response in apprentice training. Apprentices should be aware of how to respond to an electrical accident or arc flash (e.g., know where the nearest disconnect is, how to use a fire extinguisher on electrical fires, and first aid measures for electrical burns)."
