Testing, Commissioning & Inspections - Commercial Electrical Work Guide
Overview
【36†embed_image】 An electrician verifies control panels during the commissioning phase of a commercial project. Thorough testing and inspections ensure the installation operates safely and meets design specifications. Large-scale commercial electrical projects – from high-rises and data centers to warehouses, hotels, and big office buildings – culminate in a critical phase: Testing, Commissioning & Inspections. This phase occurs after installation is largely complete, and its purpose is to verify that all electrical systems are safe, code-compliant, and fully functional before the facility is turned over for use. In new construction, this means methodically checking every feeder, circuit, and piece of equipment for proper operation and safety. In retrofit or tenant improvement work, it also involves careful integration with existing systems, minimizing downtime and ensuring new additions don’t adversely affect what’s already in place. Commissioning is especially significant on large projects because of the complexity and interdependence of systems. A high-rise or data center’s electrical infrastructure might include normal and emergency power systems, generators, UPS units, complex controls, and integration with HVAC, fire alarms, and building management systems. Proper commissioning provides confidence that these components work together as designed. It helps catch issues like wiring errors, malfunctioning equipment, or code violations before occupants move in or sensitive operations go live, preventing costly rework or dangerous failures. Inspections – typically by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) such as a city electrical inspector – are the formal check that the installation meets all applicable codes (NEC and local Chicago code in our case) and standards. Passing inspection is required to energize the system fully and obtain occupancy approval. For a general foreman, understanding this phase is crucial: it’s where the quality of all prior work is proven. A disciplined approach to testing and commissioning can make the difference in delivering a project on time and ensuring safety. In summary, this phase verifies the integrity, safety, and performance of the electrical installation, solidifying the project’s success.

Detailed Code References
Testing and commissioning activities must comply with the National Electrical Code (NEC 2023) requirements, as well as any local amendments – in Chicago’s case, the Chicago Electrical Code. Below is a breakdown of key code sections relevant to this phase, and how they guide electricians during testing, commissioning, and inspections:
NEC 110.7 – Wiring Integrity: NEC 110.7 requires that after installation, the wiring system be free from improper connections (no shorts or unwanted grounds). In practice, this translates to performing tests to confirm there are no short circuits or ground faults before energizing circuits. For example, a megger or continuity tester should be used to verify no phase-to-phase or phase-to-ground shorts. NEC 110.7 essentially mandates an electrical continuity and insulation check as a quality step: “Completed wiring installations shall be free from short circuits, ground faults, or any connections to ground”【51†L207-L214】. This is usually achieved by the installer’s own tests (the code doesn’t dictate the method, just the outcome). A foreman should ensure every circuit is rang out (tested) and any faults cleared prior to energization, to both comply with code and protect equipment.
NEC 110.14(D) – Terminal Torqueing: Modern codes require that electrical connections are made using proper torque. NEC 110.14(D) specifically states that if the equipment listing or instructions specify a tightening torque for a lug or screw terminal, you must use a calibrated torque tool to achieve that value【14†L246-L254】. This is an often overlooked requirement during commissioning – inspectors in 2023 expect to see that all panel lugs, breaker terminals, bus connections, etc., have been torqued to spec. Many general foremen now keep torque wrench records or have electricians initial a torque log for each panel. This ensures safety (loose connections cause heat and failures) and code compliance. During final inspections, especially in Chicago, inspectors may ask if terminations have been torqued or even spot-check a random connection.
NEC 408.4(A) – Circuit Directory and Labeling: For every panelboard or switchboard, the NEC requires a directory identifying all circuits. NEC 408.4(A) states that every circuit and circuit modification shall be legibly identified as to purpose or use【21†L1-L4】. In practical terms, before calling for inspection, a foreman should ensure all panel schedules are updated and accurate (matching any circuit changes made in the field). Each breaker must correspond to a description (e.g. “Lobby lighting” or “Server Room AHU-1”) that is clear. Likewise, any junction boxes or disconnects might need labeling per plans or spec (and some per code, such as emergency system boxes). Chicago code also emphasizes labeling; while based on NEC here, the inspector will definitely fail a panel with missing or illegible circuit IDs. Good commissioning practice includes cross-checking that what’s written on the directory is correct – often by toggling circuits or using circuit tracers to confirm.
NEC 700.3 – Emergency Systems Testing: Article 700 of the NEC deals with emergency systems (like emergency lighting and backup power). Commissioning these systems is critical for life safety. NEC 700.3 requires both an acceptance test at installation and routine maintenance testing thereafter【18†L23-L31】. For instance, when installing an emergency generator and automatic transfer switch (ATS), the code expects an initial performance test. This usually means simulating a power failure to ensure the generator kicks on and the ATS transfers load within the required 10 seconds for emergency loads. It also means verifying emergency lights illuminate for at least 90 minutes on battery (as required by 700.12(F) for unit equipment)【18†L23-L31】. In Chicago, these tests are often witnessed by the electrical inspector or a specialized commissioning agent. NEC 700.3(A) specifically mentions a “Commissioning test” where the AHJ or engineer can witness the system function properly. Additionally, a new NEC 2023 requirement (700.3(F)) mandates facilities with a single emergency power source (generator) to have a way to connect a temporary generator during maintenance【18†L29-L37】【18†L46-L54】. For a foreman, that means if the project has a generator, you might need to install a generator docking station or cam-lock panel (so a portable can be hooked up). This is a code-driven addition that should be tested as well (e.g., actually try connecting a portable generator if available, or at least demonstrate the interlock works).
NEC 250.4(A)(5) and 250.53 – Grounding and Bonding Verification: The NEC requires all metal parts likely to become energized to be properly bonded and for the grounding electrode system to be effective. While much of Article 250 is about installation, one part relevant to commissioning is 250.53(A)(2) regarding ground rod electrodes. It says that a single ground rod must have a resistance to earth of 25 ohms or less, or else a supplemental electrode is required. In practice, many contractors choose to drive two ground rods for every service (spaced 6 feet apart) by default, to satisfy this without needing to perform a resistance test. If only one rod is used, you would need to use a ground resistance tester (three-point fall-of-potential method) to prove to the inspector it’s ≤ 25 Ω, or else add another rod【45†L64-L72】【45†L82-L90】. Chicago inspectors almost always expect two rods or a test report. During commissioning, ensure all bonding jumpers are landed (e.g. water pipe bonds, building steel bonds) – inspectors will visually check those. Testing the continuity of the grounding system (e.g. with an ohmmeter, verify near-zero ohms between all accessible bonded parts and the main ground) is a good practice even if not explicitly mandated in every case. This catches missing connections that could be hazardous later.
NEC 240 and 715 – Device Settings and Testing: If the project involves adjustable trip circuit breakers, protective relays, or dimmer/lighting control systems, there are code-related settings to verify. NEC 240.6 allows adjustable-trip breakers, but they must be set according to the approved plans (typically the engineer provides a coordination study). Commissioning should include checking that breakers’ Long-Time/Short-Time/Instantaneous settings or ground-fault pickups match the design. Also, if arc-flash reduction maintenance switches (240.67 or .87 in 2020/2023 NEC for fuses/breakers) are present, ensure they function. For lighting, NEC 715 (if applicable, for lighting systems) or energy code requirements might require programming occupancy sensors or daylight controls correctly. While not directly 
MPOFCINCI.COM
PA 72 (fire alarm code) might be referenced for testing emergency alarm circuits – but from an electrician standpoint, coordinate with the fire alarm contractor for those.
NEC 110.16 – Arc Flash Warning Labels: As part of final readiness, NEC 110.16 requires that certain equipment (like switchboards, panelboards, industrial control panels, etc., that are likely to require examination while energized) have a field-applied warning label about arc flash hazards. The code doesn’t mandate the detailed ANSI Z535 style label by itself (that’s typically OSHA/NFPA 70E driven), but it does require at least a generic warning. However, the 2023 NEC expanded 110.16(B) to require a label with available fault current and clearing time on service equipment ≥1000A【17†L29-L33】. In Chicago, compliance with labeling rules is taken seriously – missing arc-flash warning stickers or incorrect info can hold up the inspection. Therefore, part of commissioning is ensuring these safety labels (including things like voltage ratings, “Emergency Power” plaques, “Panelboard feeders fed from ___”) are all in place.
Chicago Electrical Code Amendments: The City of Chicago’s electrical code is based on the NEC (historically based on NEC 2017 with amendments as of the 2018 Chicago Code update), but it includes numerous amendments that affect installation and, by extension, testing and inspection:
Metallic Raceway Requirement: One hallmark of Chicago’s code is that virtually all wiring must be in metallic raceway or conduit. Unlike the NEC which allows nonmetallic cables (NM, PVC conduit, etc.) in many situations, Chicago prohibits NM cable in all occupancies and requires EMT or rigid conduit for almost all wiring (with few exceptions). For example, flexible metal conduit (FMC) or metal-clad cable (MC) is only allowed in limited retrofit scenarios (behind existing finished walls or ceilings, up to 25 feet)【7†L47-L53】. This means an inspector in Chi​
JADELEARNING.COM
il an installation if they see Romex or plastic pipe where it’s not explicitly allowed. For commissioning, this impacts things like continuity tests – metallic conduit as the ground path means verifying bonding at couplings and connectors is important. It also affects planning any changes during a tenant improvement: you might not run a quick cable whip – you’ll need pipe. The code’s rationale is increased fire safety and durability, but electricians must be aware of it throughout. During inspection, expect the Chicago inspector to pay extra attention to proper conduit supports, connectors, and that no forbidden wiring methods were used.
AFCI/GFCI and the “Chicago Tradeoff”: Chicago’s amendments have historically modified some of the NEC’s AFCI requirements in dwellings. Because Chicago uses metallic raceway (which offers some protection against arc faults), the 2018 Chicago Code provided exceptions to NEC 210.12 (AFCI protection) when certain conditions are met【7†L38-L45】. For instance, if an entire circuit is in EMT conduit and metal boxes, Chicago might not require an AFCI breaker for a retrofit. However, GFCI requirements (for shock protection) are generally as strict or stricter than NEC. Expanded GFCI requirements in the 2017/2020 NEC (like for 240V appliances) were adopted in Chicago as well【6†L7-L14】. For a commissioning perspective, ensure all required GFCI receptacles and breakers are present and trip properly. If any exceptions are claimed (like not using AFCI in a certain location due to conduit), have the code language on hand for the inspector. Always verify all kitchen, restroom, rooftop, and outdoor receptacles trip a GFCI tester – Chicago will definitely check those during inspection.
Emergency Systems and Lighting (Chicago Amendments to Article 700): Chicago often layers additional requirements on emergency lighting and power. For example, Chicago historically required that emergency lighting in high-rises be on separate circuits/feeders dedicated to that purpose (ensuring no single point of failure with normal lighting). The Chicago code also long mandated that emergency feeders be in 2-hour rated enclosures or structural concrete for high-rises (even before the NEC added similar rules). Under the 2018 Chicago code aligned with NEC 2017, they included specific rules in Article 700 regarding emergency lighting systems【7†L38-L45】. In practice, when commissioning a Chicago project, you should double-check things like: Are emergency light fixtures fed from life-safety panels as required? Does the generator supply the fire pump and life-safety loads separately from optional standby loads? Chicago inspectors may ask for the sequence of operations on loss of power – you might have to demonstrate, for instance, that within 10 seconds, all exit signs and standby lights are on (via generator or battery). Also, Chicago did not adopt some newer NEC relaxations – for example, they might require manual transfer switches for emergency power have an external indicator or prohibitions on load shed that NEC might not. Always consult the Chicago amendments for Article 700 to ensure compliance. One known Chicago-specific: the use of emergency lighting maintenance bypass switches (to test emergency lights from normal power) is something Chicago often requires in large buildings.
Other Chicago Differences: A few other notable points: Chicago historically required all conductors to be copper (no aluminum in feeders, though this has been relaxed in recent code for large feeders with conditions). Chicago also had an old rule requiring red-colored conduit for fire alarm circuits; this was repealed in the newer code to align with NEC (so now using red electrical tape or labels is acceptable instead of an all-red pipe)【49†L23-L28】. Nonetheless, during commissioning, ensure fire alarm wiring (which is usually done by a different contractor) is separated per code and in conduit – inspectors coordinate so that electrical and fire alarm rough inspections align in Chicago. Finally, Chicago’s inspection process might require the supervising electrician’s presence and signature on certain test affidavits. It’s common in Chicago to submit a “letter of compliance” or test reports (e.g., for insulation resistance or system functionality) to the inspector or building department. Being prepared with documentation citing the Chicago code sections can smooth the inspection.
In summary, adherence to NEC 2023 is the baseline, covering everything from ensuring safe installations (110.7, 110.14) to proper labeling (408.4) and functional testing of critical systems (700.3). The Chicago Electrical Code overlays additional stricter requirements primarily in wiring methods and some safety systems. A general foreman in Chicago must be fluent in both sets of rules. When in doubt, consult the latest Chicago amendments – they are usually published as a modified version of the NEC. Properly following code in the Testing & Commissioning phase means your work will stand up to scrutiny and, most importantly, the electrical system will be safe and reliable for users.
Step-by-Step Installation Guide
Although most “installation” of equipment is completed by this phase, a step-by-step guide to the commissioning and inspection process will ensure nothing is missed. Below is a structured approach that an apprentice or journeyman can follow, which a general foreman would typically orchestrate. Each step includes what to do, safety tips, and labor considerations (with NECA labor unit references where applicable):
Review Documentation & Plan Commissioning – Before touching anything, gather all relevant documents: electrical drawings, one-line diagrams, panel schedules, equipment submittals, and any commissioning checklists provided by the engineer or company. Go through these documents to plan the sequence of tests. For new construction, plan to start testing in sections (e.g., by area or system). For retrofits, schedule work in phases to minimize impact on the existing operations (for example, plan a weekend outage for tie-ins and testing). Ensure you have any required test equipment on hand (megger, multimeter, etc.) and calibrated if needed. Safety Tip: Identify any circuits that may already be energized (in a retrofit, existing panels will be live) and communicate clear lockout/tagout procedures. Labor unit note: Planning isn’t in NECA units, but it pays off by avoiding rework. Allocate perhaps 4-8 hours of foreman time for thorough planning on a large project – it will save far more in efficiency later.
Pre-Inspection of Workmanship – This is an internal audit before formal tests. Walk the project and do a visual inspection of all electrical installs. Ensure all cables are terminated, all panels and junction boxes have covers (except those you are actively testing), and there is no damage. Check that wire markings are in place, and that there are no obvious code violations (like a conduit missing a strap, or an incorrect bend radius on cable). Verify that the workspace around equipment is clear (NEC 110.26 working clearances need to be met – e.g. no storage in front of electrical panels). Safety Tip: This is a good time to clear debris and ensure panelboards are closed if not being worked on, to prevent any accidental contact. Labor: NECA doesn’t list a “visual inspection” unit, but this is typically a part of the job – expect a few hours of electricians’ time walking down even a mid-sized project. (For example, 0.2 hours per device or panel just to eyeball and tighten things as needed.)
Equipment-Specific Manufacturer Checks – Many large electrical components (transformers, switchgear, VFDs, generators) come with manufacturer-recommended commissioning tests or initialization procedures. For instance, switchgear might require verifying all fuse sizes or breaker settings, a VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) might need programming before use, and an emergency generator likely requires initial oil level checks and battery checks. Follow NEC 110.3(B) – which means adhere to manufacturer instructions. If a gear’s manual says “megger the bus for 1 minute at 1000V,” do so (after disconnecting any sensitive components). If a panelboard’s instructions say to torque all connections to X value, ensure that’s done (as required by code)【14†L246-L254】. Safety Tip: Ensure equipment is de-energized for these initial checks. Use lockout/tagout on feeder breakers feeding any panel before opening it to check torque. Labor: These tasks can vary widely. NECA labor units might give, for example, ~0.8 hours for setting up and testing a typical 75 kVA transformer (including megger and turns ratio test by a crew). Adjust for difficulty – a cramped electrical room might increase the time.
Continuity Testing of Circuits – Now begin formal electrical tests. For each branch circuit and feeder, perform continuity checks. This ensures that conductors are not open and that the intended path is correct. A common method: use an ohmmeter or buzzer to verify that each conductor is continuous end-to-end. Also verify neutrals and ground conductors continuity. For long runs, an apprentice can assist by temporarily connecting a hot and neutral together at one end and testing for continuity at the other (then repeat for hot-ground, etc., effectively “ringing out” the run). In a conduit system, also confirm that metal conduits are properly bonded (you can use the conduit as a return path in some tests to ensure 
ECMAG.COM
are good). Safety Tip: Make absolutely sure the circuit is not energized during these tests. Lock out the breaker feeding that circuit (or don’t turn it on yet) and tag it as “Testing in progress”. Labor: NECA’s Manual might suggest something like 0.05 hours per continuity test per 100 ft (approximately 3 minutes) under normal conditions. So, for a floor with 100 circuits, pure continuity testing might be ~5 hours of work for a team (whic​
ECMAG.COM
our JSON labor estimate of 0.05 hr per circuit). This can often be sped up by doing multiple circuits in parallel if you have multiple multimeters and helpers.
Insulation Resistance Testing (Megger) – After basic continuity, perform insulation resistance tests on important feeders and any critical or long branch circuits. Using a megohmmeter (e.g., a Megger or Fluke insulation tester), test between each conductor and ground, and between phase conductors of feeders, typically at 500V or 1000V DC depending on system voltage. Record the 
NECANET.ORG
e readings in megaohms. Standards often accept anything above, say, 50 MΩ for new cable on a 600V system, but even readings in the hundreds of MΩ are common for brand new wires. Test motors and transformers (with their windings disconnected from other components) to ensure no winding shorts to ground. Safety Tip: Megger tests apply high DC voltage – keep everyone clear of the conductors under test to avoid shock. After testing a cable, always discharge it (most modern megohmmeters do this automatically) to bleed off charge. Also, disconnect sensitive electronic devices on the circuit – for example, smoke detectors, electronic ballasts, or drives should be isolated because a megger’s high voltage can damage them. Labor: Insulation testing might be ~0.1 to 0.2 hours per cable end in NECA terms (our quick reference gave 0.5 hr for a feeder, which might include setup). Plan on a couple hours for a typical floor’s feeders. Larger projects often bring in a third-party testing firm for main feeder megger tests – they can do it faster with multiple sets.
Grounding System Tests – Ensure all grounding connections are tight (perform torque per specs on ground bars, etc.). If required (or if only one ground rod was installed), perform a ground electrode resistance test. The fall-of-potential test involves driving two temporary stakes in soil and using a ground tester to measure the resistance of the building’s ground system. Often, as mentioned, this can be skipped by installing two ground rods (code allows that in lieu of testing)【45†L88-L96】. But high-end projects or spec compliance might still require a reading (especially for data centers or if an engineered grounding system was installed). If the reading comes out higher than 25 ohms (the NEC benchmark), drive additional rods or improve the grounding (moistening soil, using chemical grounds, etc.), then re-test. Safety Tip: When doing a fall-of-potential test, ensure the building ground is disconnected from the electrical service neutral (otherwise you’ll read parallel paths). This means you should schedule this test when you can safely lift the grounding electrode conductor off the neutral bar (typically before the system is energized). Labor: Ground testing using 3-point method might be about 2-3 hours for setup and execution if done manually. (Our checklist didn’t list a specific NECA unit, as many just default to installing two rods to avoid this.)
Panelboard and Gear Checks – Now perform a comprehensive check on each panelboard, switchboard, and piece of switchgear. This includes: verifying every screw terminal is tight (again, torque to spec), all circuit breakers are the correct amperage per the drawings, and that each breaker is in the right space per the circuit directory. If the project has adjustable circuit breakers or protective relays (say at the main switchgear or large distribution panels), set them now according to the coordination study or engineer’s settings sheet. Many modern breakers have dip switches or dials for Long-Time delay, Short-Time pickup, etc. Set those with reference to the documentation. Safety Tip: Ideally do this with the gear de-energized. If some gear must be checked while hot (not recommended, but sometimes main gear might be already live in a retrofit), use appropriate PPE and keep one hand in your pocket when near live parts to avoid creating a path across your body. For any settings changes on live equipment, extreme caution or better – schedule an outage to do it de-energized. Labor: For a standard 42-circuit lighting panel, NECA might assign roughly 1 to 2 hours to do the terminations initially; checking/tightening in commissioning might add 0.5 hour. Our labor chart gave 1.5 hours per panel for inspection & torque – that covers opening it up, torqueing perhaps ~100 screws (including neutrals, ground, phase lugs), and reassembling. For larger switchboards, allow more time – e.g. a 2000A switchboard might take a couple hou​

8. Functional Testing of Equipment – With basic electrical tests done, proceed to functional tests of systems and equipment. This means actually operating the equipment in as close to real conditions as possible:
Lighting Circuits: Flip on all lighting breakers and control switches to ensure lights illuminate. Test any 3-way or 4-way switching setups for proper function. For automated lighting controls, test sensors and time clocks to ensure lights respond (might require coordinating with commissioning agent if present).
Receptacle Circuits: Use a plug-in tester on random outlets to check correct wiring (hot-neutral reversed, etc., should be caught here if any). Also test GFCI outlets by pressing their test button and with an external tester – they should trip and cut power. AFCI breakers (if used) should be tested using their test button as well.

y correct rotation on all three-phase motors – use a phase rotation meter ahead of energizing, or do a brief “bump” test (quick on-off) to observe rotation. If a motor runs backwards, swap any two phase leads on that motor’s starter or disconnect to correct it. Check that VFDs run the motors and that any control interlocks (like an airflow proving switch that should cut the motor) work. Many HVAC units have multiple power feeds (one for the unit, one for heat, etc.); test each.

if the fire alarm is supposed to trip shunt relays to drop power to magnetic door holders or to elevator power, those circuits were wired by the electricians. You will simulate a fire alarm (usually by the fire alarm tech initiating an alarm) and confirm those relays operated – i.e., power is cut where it should be. If the building has an emergency generator, part of this is confirming the fire alarm sends a run signal to the generator or that the ATS sends the signal to the fire panel (depending on design).
Generator/ATS: For standby power systems, perform a full blackout test. Usually, the procedure is: turn off the main feeder (or simulate utility loss) to the building or the emergency panel. The generator should auto-start (typically within a few seconds) and the Automatic Transfer Switch transfers the load to generator power within 10 seconds (for emergency loads per code). Verify critical things happen: emergency lights turn on (if they were off), possibly elevator homing sequence initiates (elevators should return to ground floor on power loss if on standby power), and that no circuit breaker trips during the transfer. Let the generator run and carry the load for a while (often a 2-hour load test is required by spec). Monitor generator vital signs (oil pressure, temperature, etc., usually done by manufacturer’s rep or a third-party). Then restore utility power and ensure the re-transfer is smooth and the generator shuts down after cooldown. Labor Tip: This step often involves multiple trades and sometimes manufacturer reps (generator tech or testing company). As a foreman, ensure everyone knows the plan to avoid chaos when power is killed. Assign someone at the generator controls, someone at the main gear, and communicators with radios.
UPS Systems: If a data center or critical facility has UPS units, the commissioning will involve a battery load test. Often a load bank is connected and the UPS is made to run on battery to see that it can hold the load for the specified time (e.g., 15 minutes). This might be done by specialists, but electricians set up the temporary load and ensure safe connections.
Other Systems: Test any automatic controls, like automatic load shed schemes, or the activation of exhaust fans on emergency power, etc. If the building has a building management system (BMS), by this point all the electrical points (like status contacts from breakers, generator running status, etc.) should be wired in – verify with the BMS technician that each point is reporting correctly.
Safety Tips for Functional Testing: Many of these tests involve intentional loss of power or starting large equipment. Ensure all personnel are aware of the tests to avoid panic (“Is that alarm real or a test?”). Use lockout/tagout where needed – for example, when verifying an exhaust fan shuts down on fire alarm, you might cut its power via a controlled method rather than actually starting a fire alarm if possible. Always have emergency stops in mind – know how to quickly shut down the generator if something goes wrong during testing. For live testing, appropriate PPE is a must (arc flash suit for switching operations, etc., as determined by arc-flash study labels). Labor: Functional testing can be time-consuming. NECA labor units for installing equipment do not always account for the detailed testing since that is often considered nonproductive or startup labor. However, one can estimate: a generator and ATS full test might take a crew of 4 electricians 4-8 hours (16-32 labor hours) including setup and wrap-up. Testing a single motor circuit might take 0.2 hours (12 minutes) for rotation check. Our earlier labor list gave 4.0 hours for a generator/ATS test which is an average for the electrical work part, but coordination often adds to that. It’s important to track these hours to compare against estimate – if the job was bid with certain startup labor in mind, see if you’re within that.
Issue Resolution and Re-Testing – It is almost inevitable on large projects that some tests will reveal problems. Perhaps a feeder shows low insulation resistance because a screw pinched a wire; or a motor ran backward and got damaged; or a panel schedule was wrong and half the lights didn’t come on. When an issue is found, document it on a punch list. Fix the issue (replace cable, swap phases, update the schedule, etc.), then re-test the affected system. Never assume a fix is good without re-testing – you need to show a clear test result post-repair. This iterative process might go on for a few days to a few weeks on a huge project. Prioritize issues that could impact life safety first (e.g., ground fault on an emergency circuit) versus minor issues (like a mislabeled cover plate). Safety Tip: If a repair involves additional work (like pulling a new wire), treat that with the same safety measures as initial install – de-energize, lockout, PPE, etc. Labor: Factor in some contingency. NECA does not explicitly account for “rework labor” in the base units, but good estimators include some testing/commissioning allowance. A rough guide might be to add 5-10% of the installation labor for commissioning tasks. Tracking the hours spent here and noting common issues can help future projects (maybe next time they’ll install with those issues in mind to reduce rework).
Final Quality Control Check (Pre-Inspection) – Before calling the inspector, do a final QC walkthrough. This is essentially a repeat of step 2 but after all testing is done and any open items fixed. Ensure all panel covers, device plates, and enclosure doors are properly closed and secured. All labeling should be in place: panel directories updated, panels and disconnects labeled as required (“Panel LP-1”, “Main Service Disconnect”, etc.), arc flash or warning labels applied, circuit breaker panel blanks in any empty slots. Use a torque screwdriver to spot-check a couple of random terminals as a confidence check. Verify also that documentation is ready – many inspectors in Chicago will want to see documents like the insulation test log, or a letter stating the service ground was tested or that the fire pump was tested. Have those papers ready in a binder. If any permits or paperwork need to be on site (like the electrical permit card or stamped drawings), have them available. Safety Tip: Treat this like the real inspection – check that working clearances are not temporarily blocked by ladders or materials, and that the electrical room is clean. Remove any tools or temporary jumpers used during testing. If any circuits were left disconnected for testing and not put back, terminate them now or cap them safely. Labor: This might be another couple hours of walkthrough for one or two people. It’s time well spent to avoid failing an inspection for a simple oversight.
Official Inspection with AHJ – Now it’s time for the AHJ (inspector) to come. Usually, the general foreman or a master electrician will walk with the inspector. For apprentices and journeymen, it’s good to be present if allowed, to hear the inspector’s feedback (and it shows confidence in your work). During the inspection, expect the inspector to randomly check things: they might remove a panel cover (so have tools handy to assist and kill power if needed), test a GFCI, measure a working clearance, or ask questions about the installation (“Are all those MC cables sleeved in conduit in that plenum as required?” etc.). Answer honestly and confidently, citing code or Chicago amendments if relevant. If you don’t know an answer, it’s okay for the foreman to say “I’ll verify that in the codebook and get back to you” rather than guess. Trade Coordination: Sometimes other inspectors (fire department, elevator inspector) are involved at this stage – be ready to coordinate any demonstration for them as well (like the fire alarm test results). Labor: The inspection itself isn’t usually counted in labor units, but practically, a couple of electricians should be on hand during inspection to assist or immediately address any minor fixes the inspector might allow on the spot (for example, tightening a lug or adding a missing clamp).
Follow-Up and Turnover – If the inspection passes, congratulations – you can proceed to energize the system fully and turn it over to the client. If there are deficiencies noted (often given on a correction notice), address them promptly. For any major re-inspection, follow the steps again for that scope and get it signed off. Finally, compile all testing documentation (often owners require a commissioning report with all readings, settings, etc.). This creates a reference for maintenance down the road. Conduct a handover meeting or training with the building maintenance personnel if that’s part of the project (common for systems like generators, fire pumps – the electrician might explain the location of disconnects, how to reset things, etc.).
Each of these steps ensures a thorough and safe commissioning. Skipping steps often leads to painful discoveries later (like a load not on emergency power during a real outage, or a cable failing under load because it wasn’t meggered). By following a methodical approach, a foreman can deliver a project phase that is on-time, passes inspection, and performs reliably when the building is occupied.
Materials Deep Dive
During the testing and commissioning phase, a variety of specialized materials and equipment are used – different from the conduit, wire, and fixtures of the installation phase. Here we’ll dive into key materials and tools that electricians should be familiar with, including their specs, when to use them, and some recommended brands commonly trusted in the industry (including those popular in union shops like IBEW Local 134 in Chicago):
Insulation Resistance Tester (Megohmmeter): This is a device used to perform megger tests, injecting a high DC voltage (250V, 500V, 1000V are common ranges) into a conductor to measure the resistance of insulation. A good megohmmeter is essential for commissioning – it reveals issues like nicked wires or moisture that could cause faults. Specs: Look for a tester with at least a 1000V range (for 600V systems) and a resistance measurement up to 1 GΩ (gigaohm). Modern digital meggers often have PI (Polarization Index) and DAR (Dielectric Absorption Ratio) functions for motor testing. Usage: Use on de-energized circuits only, and discharge after testing. Brands: Megger is literally a brand (and synonymous with the device) – their MIT series is popular. Fluke also makes reliable insulation testers (e.g. Fluke 1507). Another brand is AEMC. Union electricians often favor Megger and Fluke for their durability. These testers come with lead sets – take care to keep them clean and dry for accurate readings.
Multimeter (True RMS Digital Multimeter): The multimeter is the workhorse tool for any electrician. During commissioning, it’s used to measure voltages (line voltages, control voltages), verify absence of voltage before working, measure resistance for continuity checks, and sometimes current (if it has a clamp or with separate clamp attachment). Specs: True RMS capability is important for accurate AC readings, especially if measuring non-sinusoidal waveforms (like on VFD outputs). Category III or IV safety rating (600V CAT III is a minimum for building electrical work). Auto-ranging is convenient. When to Use: At every step – verifying circuits are de-energized, checking phase-to-phase voltage after energizing to ensure it’s correct (~480V or ~208V as expected), testing control transformer outputs (120V, 24V), etc. Brands: Fluke 87V or Fluke 179 are gold standards – they’re rugged and reliable (the Fluke 179 is pictured above【38†embed_image】 and is a common True RMS meter). Other decent brands: Klein Tools MM series (cost-effective for apprentices), Keysight (Agilent) for high-end accuracy, Amprobe. IBEW training centers often demonstrate with Fluke meters. Always check the meter’s fuse (especially if someone tried to measure current in the wrong port – a common mistake that blows the fuse).
Clamp-On Ammeter (Current Clamp Meter): While a multimeter can measure current by breaking the circuit and inserting in series, a clamp meter lets you measure AC current by simply clamping around a conductor – crucial for commissioning load tests. Many modern clamp meters also measure inrush current, which is useful when checking motor start-up currents or verifying a circuit’s load profile. Specs: Jaw size that can accommodate large feeders (at least up to 500MCM or so). AC current range to 600A or more for services (some go to 1000A). If DC current measurement is needed (for battery systems or DC buses), get one that does AC/DC. Use: After energizing, clamp each phase of major loads to ensure currents are balanced and within expected range. For example, clamp the three phases feeding a panel under load – see if one phase draws significantly more (could indicate an imbalance or a miswire). Check neutral current in panels with a lot of non-linear loads (computers, etc.) – if high, it might hint at harmonics. Also use for testing 3-phase rotation (some clamps have phase rotation or you can infer by sequence of currents in some advanced tools). Brands: Fluke (like Fluke 376 FC) is widely used. Amprobe originated the design and is still reputable. Klein also offers decent clamp meters for lower budget. Many electricians carry a clamp meter combined with a multimeter (either a separate device or those clamp-meters that also have multimeter functions).
Ground Resistance Tester (Earth Ground Tester): This is a more specialized instrument used to measure the resistance of the ground electrode system. It usually comes with auxiliary ground stakes and long leads. Some models can do a 3-point fall-of-potential test; others can do a 4-point Wenner test (for soil resistivity). There are even clamp-on ground testers that measure ground loop resistance without auxiliary rods (useful in existing buildings). Specs: A typical kit will have at least two ground stakes and lead reels (say 50ft and 100ft reels). It should measure down to fractions of an ohm (since a good ground might be <5Ω in some cases). Use: As described earlier, to verify a ground rod’s effectiveness if only one is used, or for critical facilities where they want a record of actual ground resistance. On existing towers or in dense urban areas, clamp-on testers can measure the net grounding system resistance by clamping around the grounding electrode conductor. Brands: Fluke has a model (Fluke 1623-2 for example). AEMC and Megger also make ground resistance testers. For most projects, contractors might rent this device if needed due to cost. In union circles, often a testing subcontractor (who might be a member of IBEW but works for a testing firm) will perform this test using their high-end equipment (like Megger or Omicron brand test sets).
Labeling Equipment (Printer and Supplies): Proper labeling is a significant part of commissioning. This includes circuit labels on wires, panel and switchgear nameplates, and adhesive labels for things like “FEEDER 4 FROM PANEL H1” on a junction box. Equipment: Portable label printers like the Brady BMP21 or DYMO XTL are handy for on-site labeling. These print on durable nylon or polyester labels that stick on panels or wrap around cables. For larger jobs, a desktop label plotter might be used to create engraved tags or laminated labels (some contractors have an in-house engraving machine or order engraved phenolic labels for equipment). Specs: Use UV-resistant labels for outdoor or high-heat areas. For wire labels, heat-shrink sleeves printed by a Brady or Panduit printer give a clean result that won’t fall off. When to Use: As you finish connections, label all feeders and circuits. Commissioning is when you verify labels, so having the printer on hand to fix any that are wrong or missing is useful. Brands: Brady is a union favorite for industrial-grade labelers. Panduit has the Panther printer line. Brother makes the P-Touch Edge series which is decent for smaller jobs. Make sure to use the correct label cartridges (for example, self-laminating wire labels vs. panel labels). This material might seem minor, but inspectors pay attention to labeling, and good labels make life easier for anyone servicing the system later.
Torque Wrenches and Screwdrivers: We mentioned this in context of NEC 110.14(D). The actual tools include torque screwdrivers (inch-pound settings for smaller terminals) and torque wrenches (foot-pound or larger inch-pound for bigger lugs). Specs: Should be calibrated (usually annually) and capable of the torque range needed. For example, a typical panel lug might require 50 in-lb – a torque screwdriver that covers 5–50 in-lb is needed. Big switchgear lugs might need 250 in-lb (which is about 20 ft-lb) so a 3/8” drive torque wrench might be required, or even 1/2” drive for very large bus connections (those could be 300+ in-lb). Usage: Follow a tightening sequence if provided (for bus bars, you tighten in a pattern like car wheel lug nuts). Use the correct bit (Philips, hex, etc.) and apply steady force until the tool clicks (for click-type) or shows the value on a digital readout. Avoid using torque tools as your everyday screwdriver – they are for final torque, not driving in screws from loose (that can wear them out of calibration). Brands: Wiha and Wera make excellent torque screwdrivers for electricians. CDI (Snap-On) and Proto make reliable torque wrenches. Even Craftsman or Husky torque wrenches can be used if calibrated. Some companies provide these to crews for commissioning; others have just the foreman or QC person use them. In union training, apprentices learn about torque requirements and may practice with these tools, as code compliance is increasingly enforced.
Infrared Thermographic Camera: This is used typically during or after commissioning when systems are under load. The camera shows heat patterns, allowing detection of loose connections or overloaded circuits by spotting “hot spots.” Specs: Resolution and focus ability are key – a 120x120 pixel IR sensor is entry-level, 320x240 or higher is more advanced. Even an entry thermal imager can detect a connection that is, say, 20°C hotter than others. Many imagers now are point-and-shoot with a screen that overlaps IR image with a visual image. Use: After the system has been energized and under load for a period (maybe during that 2-hour load test on the generator, or when the building is running near full load), scan all major panels and switchboards. Look at cable lugs, breaker terminals, bus joints. Uniformly cool is good; a hotspot indicates higher resistance (often a loose or corroded connection). Also scan motors and transformers – a hotspot could show a phase imbalance or other issue. This is usually done before final sign-off and often a report is generated for the owner. Brands: FLIR is a leader in IR cameras (e.g., FLIR E6 or E8). Fluke also has a Ti series of IR cameras. There are even smartphone attachments (FLIR One) that some use for quick checks, though not as high quality. Some NECA contractors have these as part of their service tools, or they might hire a thermographer for a day. In IBEW circles, using IR is standard in preventive maintenance, and it’s creeping into new commissioning too.
Temporary Power and Load Devices: Sometimes to test a system, you need to simulate loads or provide temporary sources. Examples:
Load Banks: These are portable units that draw a defined load, often used to test generators or UPS under full load. They are basically big toasters (resistors with cooling fans) that can be dialed to certain kW. You might have a 100 kW load bank to test a 500 kW generator in increments (100, 200, 300… etc kW). Electricians hook them up to the generator output or a distribution panel, typically via cam-lock connectors or hardwired connections. They allow testing without needing the actual building load (which might not be fully in place yet in new construction).
Temporary Generators / Generator Docking Stations: As mentioned with NEC 700.3(F), some buildings have a docking station for portable generators. Material-wise, this is a panel (often made by companies like ESL or Russelectric) with heavy-duty connectors (cam-locks) and an interlocked breaker. Commissioning it means you may actually connect a portable generator (rented, e.g., a 1MW Aggreko unit) to verify the docking station works. The cam-lock connectors (usually color-coded: e.g., Crouse-Hinds or Marinco brand) and associated cables (4/0 gauge perhaps) are part of this material set.
Temporary UPS or Battery Banks: Less common, but if the site UPS isn’t ready, a temporary one might be used to support critical loads during testing.
Specs & Use: For load banks, ensure the voltage matches (480V or 208V units). They often need substantial ventilation (they get HOT), so use them outdoors or in large ventilated areas. Hook up with appropriately rated cables and breakers. For docking stations, ensure phase rotation is labeled and correct as per the generator. The Warning label on the docking station (like the one in the earlier image from ElectricalLicenseRenewal) must indicate the system bonding requirements【22†embed_image】. Brands: Avtron and Simplex make load banks. ESL and ASCO make generator docking stations. Makers like Regal Beloit (now Regal Rexnord) might come into play as they produce generators and motor controls – not exactly a “material” you install at this phase, but their equipment might be what you’re testing. We mention Regal Beloit here as a trusted brand especially in motor/generator tech; a foreman might coordinate with their reps if a large motor drive system is being commissioned.
Fasteners and Supports for Last-Minute Fixes: Commissioning often exposes a few physical issues – maybe a conduit isn’t properly supported or a cable needs re-routing. Having a stock of Caddy fasteners (nVent Caddy brand clips and supports) and hardware is useful. For example, if during inspection prep you find a conduit sagging, a Caddy strap or channel clamp can quickly fix it. Ramset tools (powder-actuated fastening) might be used to quickly install a support on concrete if needed – though by this phase heavy drilling should be done, sometimes a last-minute shot pin can add a missing strap in seconds. Brands: nVent Caddy is well-known for an array of electrical supports (like FL clips, rod hangers, etc.). Ramset (or Hilti’s equivalent) is common for shooting brackets into concrete or steel. DeWalt and Milwaukee are the go-to for cordless drills and impact drivers used to tighten or adjust things during commissioning.
Test Tags and Documentation Materials: When tests are done, especially for life-safety equipment, tags are often applied. For instance, a generator might get a tag indicating it was load-tested on X date. Or Arc Flash hazard labels (usually printed by an engineer after a study) get applied now – those are PVC or polyester stickers with calculated incident energy. Use: Keep a packet of any labels provided by manufacturers – e.g., panelboards often come with a slip of torque labels to stick on the inside door listing the torque requirements for that unit (fulfilling a labeling requirement of 110.24 perhaps or manufacturer spec). Also, have log forms (even just a notebook) to jot down test results as you go. Many contractors now use tablets and commissioning software to capture results digitally (which can be efficient and reduce paperwork loss). Regardless, treat documentation as a material – it needs to be “installed” (completed and handed over).
In summary, the materials in this phase are about verification and safety. High-tech instruments like meggers and thermal cameras ensure the installation is sound. Humble items like labels and logs ensure everything is properly identified and recorded. An efficient general foreman will ensure these tools are on site and in good working order before commissioning starts – there’s nothing worse than reaching the testing phase and realizing you have to scramble to borrow a megger or wait a week for a label maker. By being equipped with the above, the team can smoothly execute all required tests and fixes.
Tools Required
Testing and commissioning require not just general electrical tools but also specific tools geared towards measurement, safety, and efficiency. Below is a list of essential tools for this phase, along with their purposes, how to choose them, and tips for effective use:
Digital Multimeter (DMM): Purpose: Measuring voltage, resistance, and sometimes current; verifying circuits are de-energized; checking continuity. Selection: True RMS is a must for accuracy. Ensure it has the voltage range you need (at least 600V AC). A robust CAT III or CAT IV safety rating is crucial. Some advanced DMMs have features like low impedance mode (to prevent ghost readings) which is handy. Use Tips: Always test your meter on a known live source before and after checking a circuit to confirm it’s working (the “live-dead-live” test for safety). Use the appropriate function – for instance, don’t measure voltage on the resistance setting. When measuring resistance, isolate the component (no parallel paths). For apprentices: practice using the meter under supervision to build confidence. Effective Use: Use alligator clip attachments when possible instead of holding probes by hand, so you can keep your eyes on the meter and maintain a safe distance.
Clamp Meter: Purpose: Measuring current in conductors without disconnecting them, checking load balancing, and sometimes measuring inrush current. Selection: Choose one that fits the largest wire or bus you’ll encounter (some clamps have large jaws for multiple cables or bus bars). If you need DC current measurement (for battery systems or solar), ensure it does AC/DC. Some clamp meters double as multimeters too. Use Tips: Center the conductor in the jaws for best accuracy and make sure the jaws fully close (any gap affects reading). For low currents, some meters have a “zero” function to offset any residual reading. When checking inrush, set the meter to inrush mode before starting the motor. Effective Use: Be mindful of adjacent conductors – if others are too close, you might get induced currents; separate wires if possible. Also, measure each phase of a 3-phase system individually to truly understand load balance.
Insulation Tester (Megger): Purpose: Testing insulation quality by applying high voltage and measuring resistance. Selection: Get one with multiple test voltages (e.g., 250V, 500V, 1000V) which covers most low-voltage systems. Some have diagnostics like polarization index – useful if you’ll test motors or long cables. Also, look for one with a robust design (field use can be rough). Use Tips: Always de-energize and isolate the circuit or device under test (disconnect sensitive loads). Press test for the recommended duration (typically 1 minute for a spot reading). Observe the reading trend – if it starts high and stays high, insulation is good; if it starts high then drops significantly during the test, that could indicate absorption (sometimes normal) or a problem. Effective Use: Label each test with date and values – some meggers allow saving data. If a reading is unexpectedly low, try cleaning the terminals or ensuring no conductive dust/moisture is present; sometimes a low reading can be improved by addressing environmental factors.
Two-way Radios or Communication devices: Purpose: Coordination during tests, especially in large sites. When one electrician is at a panel and another is at the other end of a feeder, communication is vital. Selection: Radios with clear indoor range (some buildings kill cell signals, so radios help). Alternatively, cell phones or push-to-talk apps can be used if reliable in the area. Use Tips: Establish clear phrases (e.g., “Circuit 12 continuity good” or “Energizing panel in 5 seconds…3-2-1-now” etc.). Minimize chatter not related to the test for clarity. Effective Use: Use headsets in noisy environments (like generator testing – those can be loud, and a headset lets you hear the radio). Good communication prevents accidents (such as someone energizing a circuit while another is working on it unknowingly).
Headlamp or Task Lighting: Purpose: Many electrical rooms are dim or panels might be in the dark corners; a headlamp frees your hands and lets you see inside panels and gear clearly to inspect. Selection: LED headlamps with at least 200+ lumens, adjustable beam, and long battery life. Rechargeable ones are handy. Use Tips: Charge or carry spare batteries. Use the tilt feature to angle light exactly where needed. Effective Use: In switchgear commissioning, shine the light at cable terminations to see if labels are correct and connections are tight. A small flashlight is good too, but a headlamp often gives better coverage.
Infrared Thermometer or Thermal Camera: Purpose: Identify hotspots on connections without contact. (If a full thermal camera is not available, even a spot IR thermometer can detect if something is much hotter than ambient.) Selection: For an IR thermometer, choose one with a laser pointer and good distance-to-spot ratio (the further you are, the larger area it measures). For a thermal camera, as discussed, resolution and sensitivity matter. Use Tips: Remove panel covers (with safety precautions) to scan inside; IR cannot see through metal or plastic covers. For a spot IR gun, be aware it averages a spot – so move it around a connection and see the highest reading. Effective Use: Use after systems have been under load for a while. If you see a connection 20-30°C hotter than others under similar load, plan to shut down and check that connection – likely it’s loose or has high resistance. Always verify with physical checking; IR gives a clue, not a complete diagnosis.
Circuit Tracer/Toner: Purpose: In retrofit scenarios, identifying which breaker feeds which device can be tricky if records are old. A circuit tracer tool can inject a signal on a de-energized circuit and detect it in a bundle, or a plug-in transmitter can help find which breaker feeds an outlet. Selection: There are advanced tracers by Greenlee or Amprobe that can even trace live circuits. Simpler ones include a plug-in outlet beeper and a handheld detector for breakers. Use Tips: For branch circuits, the plug-in type is great: plug it in an outlet, then run the detector over the panel – it’ll beep strongest at the breaker that’s feeding that outlet. For lighting or other hardwired circuits, you may use an alligator-clip transmitter to put a tone on the wire (with the circuit off). Effective Use: Remove confusion by turning off noisy loads when tracing (some detectors can get interference). Also, ensure only one transmitter is used at a time unless your device can differentiate (to avoid cross-talk). This tool saves time which otherwise might be spent trial-and-error flipping breakers or ringing wires manually.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Purpose: While not a “tool” for working on the installation, PPE is a critical tool for personal safety during commissioning. This includes voltage rated gloves, arc flash suits, face shields, safety glasses, ear protection (for loud generator tests), and insulating mats or blankets. Selection: Based on the arc-flash study or default tables in NFPA 70E for the equipment you’re working on. Typically, for panel work up to 240V, Category 2 (8 cal/cm²) gear might be required (fire-resistant shirt and pants, arc-rated face shield, leather gloves over rubber insulating gloves if working on live parts). For higher energy equipment (like a 4000A switchboard), Category 4 (40 cal) suit might be needed for any live interaction – though ideally you do everything de-energized to avoid needing that. Use Tips: Inspect PPE before use – e.g., check gloves for pinholes (inflation test), ensure faceshield isn’t cracked, etc. Use PPE appropriate to the task: full arc suit for racking breakers or doing hot testing on gear, but you might only need safety glasses and normal gear if everything is de-energized (still need hard hat, etc., per site rules). Effective Use: Do not become complacent because PPE is on – still follow all safety rules. PPE is last line of defense. Work as if you have no protection so you naturally avoid risky contact; the PPE is there in case of a mistake or unexpected event.
Laptop with Commissioning Software or Documentation (optional but increasingly common): Purpose: Modern building systems (lighting control systems, BMS, smart breakers) often require a computer to interface or program. Also, keeping digital records of tests is easier with a laptop or tablet on site. Selection: Not a specific brand requirement, but ensure you have necessary cables (USB adapters for connecting to breakers or lighting control panels, etc.) and software installed (manufacturers often provide configuration software). Use Tips: Keep the laptop charged (bring a power bank or cord). If programming lighting scenes or breaker settings, do so systematically and backup configurations. Effective Use: Use spreadsheets to log test results as you go – many foremen have templates for insulation tests, torque logs, etc. that can be filled in. This looks professional and makes turn-over packages easier. Also, some specialized commissioning software (like for fire alarm or BMS) will produce reports – know how to run those.
Hand Tools for Adjustments: A set of quality screwdrivers (including insulated ones for control circuits), nut drivers, allen keys (many breakers or terminals use hex screws), and pliers should still be on your tool belt. Purpose: Making any adjustments or fixes found during testing – e.g., tightening a loose screw, replacing a wire nut with a larger size, etc. Selection: Insulated tools (rated to 1000V) add safety when working near live parts, though again, one tries to avoid live work. Precision screwdrivers might be needed for control terminals. Use Tips: Keep track of small tools; during commissioning you open many panels – don’t leave a tool inside a panel by accident (it happens – some poor soul finds a rusted screwdriver at the bottom of a switchboard years later!). Use the right size tool for the screw to avoid stripping it, especially when re-tightening lugs. Effective Use: If you find yourself needing an unusual tool (say a torque hex bit or a spanner), get it – don’t improvise with wrong tools as that can cause damage (e.g., using a flathead in a Phillips screw).
In essence, the required tools for this phase center on measurement, verification, and safety. A journeyman or foreman in commissioning mode becomes part-electrician, part-inspector, and even part-engineer. Having the right tools and knowing how to use them effectively ensures you can validate the installation thoroughly. Always prefer tools that give accurate data and use them in a way that that data is reliable – because decisions (pass/fail, rework or not) will be made based on those readings. Equipping the team with these tools and training them in their use is an investment in a smooth commissioning process.
Trade Coordination Details
The commissioning and inspection phase is not done in isolation by the electrical team – it requires close coordination with other trades to be successful, especially on large commercial projects where systems are interconnected. Here are detailed coordination points and advice for working with key trades during this phase:
HVAC/Mechanical Team: HVAC equipment (air handlers, chillers, exhaust fans, pumps) is often the largest load on the electrical system and has control interdependencies. Coordinate startup schedules with mechanical contractors – they typically perform “startup” of each equipment piece (often with factory reps). Ensure an electrician is present during each major equipment startup to handle any electrical issues (like motor rotation, amp draw measurements, or adjusting overload settings in starters). Many HVAC units also have interlocks controlled by fire systems or BMS – for example, a smoke detector in an air handler duct might send a signal to shut down that unit (usually via the fire alarm or a relay wired by electricians). You need to test those interlocks together: have the fire alarm tech trigger the duct detector and confirm the HVAC tech sees the unit shut off. Also plan for coordination on power quality – some large VFDs can cause harmonics; if measurements are needed, do them jointly. Scheduling: Create a joint commissioning schedule where mechanical and electrical activities are listed, so both teams know when an air handler will be energized, for instance. This avoids a scenario where a mechanical guy is trying to start a unit that the electrical team hasn’t finished wiring or testing yet, or vice versa.
Fire Alarm/Life Safety Systems: Arguably the most critical coordination. Fire alarm systems are installed by a low-voltage contractor, but the electrical team provides the power circuit to the fire alarm panel, connections to door holders, smoke evacuation fans, elevator recall, and often emergency voice/alarm speaker systems power. Plan a full integrated fire alarm test with the fire alarm contractor and fire department (typically required for occupancy). For electrical: ensure that when the fire alarm is triggered, all the things that should happen electrically do happen: e.g., emergency generator starts (this might be via a trigger from the fire panel or hardwired from ATS sensing loss of power), magnetic door holders release (closing fire doors, which you’ll see when their power drops out), elevator gets a signal to recall to ground (which usually cuts normal power and forces elevator to emergency power or to use safety mode), smoke exhaust fans turn on or off as required (some fans start to purge smoke, others stop to prevent spreading it). Coordination advice: assign one electrician to be at the fire alarm panel with the fire alarm technician, and others at various key equipment (generator, main panel, mechanical panel) during the test, all in radio contact. That way, as devices are tested zone by zone, you can quickly verify each electrical response. The Chicago Fire Department often witnesses these tests in big buildings – being organized and having tested it yourselves beforehand is crucial (you typically don’t want the first attempt in front of the fire marshal!). Also coordinate labeling – fire alarm guys will label their devices; electrical should label related control relays or circuit breakers (“FEEDS FIRE ALARM PANEL” etc.) clearly as well.
Plumbing/Fire Pump: A specific mechanical coordination – if there’s a fire pump, its testing is code-critical. Fire pumps often have controllers that the electrical team powers. The pump test will involve flowing water (conducted by sprinkler contractors) but the electricians must verify the pump’s electrical performance: does it start automatically on pressure drop, does it immediately go to full speed (fire pump controllers often across-the-line start, which is a big electrical surge – ensure your upstream breaker settings accommodate that), and does it have backup power (generator) which kicks in within 10 seconds of utility loss. Work with the fire pump technician and sprinkler guys on a test where utility power is cut to the pump (simulate worst case – fire plus outage) and see that the transfer to generator is seamless and pump keeps running. Note: By code, the fire pump line side shouldn’t be load-shed or dropped under any circumstance – coordinate with any load shedding or ATS controls that nothing can shut that pump except maybe its own breaker.
Low-Voltage and BMS (Building Management System): Modern large buildings have a Building Management System that monitors and controls HVAC, lighting, security, etc. From the electrical side, BMS often wants signals like: breaker trip status from switchgear (via auxiliary contacts), generator running status, ATS position, current readings from power meters, status of automatic lighting controls, etc. Low-voltage contractors or controls integrators handle the BMS wiring, but they will tie into equipment that the electrical team installed. Coordination item: ensure all required points (wires from a device to the control panel) are landed. For instance, if a spec says the BMS shall monitor “normal power available” at an ATS via a dry contact – the electrician should have installed that contact and run a pair for the controls guy. Commissioning time is when the controls/BMS technician tries to read those points. So schedule a session where you both go through point-to-point: e.g., turn off a breaker to see if the BMS gets the alarm. For lighting controls, if a separate contractor did it, coordinate testing automatic shutoff times, light level sensors, etc., possibly requiring electrical to override or simulate certain conditions. Tip: It helps to have an electrician with some controls knowledge liaise with BMS folks, as they speak a slightly different technical language. In Chicago high-rises, an integrated systems test (IST) is often done, where all systems including BMS, fire, security, etc., are tested together – make sure you’re part of those planning meetings.
Communications/IT: The IT room or data center will have UPS systems, special power requirements, redundant feeds. Coordinate with the IT infrastructure team regarding timing to energize server racks or network equipment – often they want stable power (tested for some days) before they turn on expensive gear. If you’re commissioning a data center floor, you might use dummy loads (like load banks or resistive heaters) to simulate server loads – coordinate with the IT or owner’s rep to allow that and to ensure it won’t interfere with any early IT setup. Also, networked electrical devices (like intelligent breakers or meters) need to be given IP addresses by the IT team – so schedule time to do this jointly. For example, an advanced power meter might need to be visible on the building network; during commissioning, the electrical team ensures it’s wired and powered, and the IT ensures it’s configured on the network. Teamwork here prevents last-minute scrambling when the owner says “I can’t see the power monitoring on my software”.
General Contractor/Construction Manager: While not a “trade” per se, coordinating with the GC is critical. They control the overall schedule and interface with the owner. Communicate clearly any outage requirements or testing events that might affect other trades or the construction site. For instance, if you’re doing a fire alarm full test, the alarms will sound – everyone on site needs to know it’s a test to avoid panic or evacuation. The GC can help by sending site-wide notices. If you need to shut power to part of the site (maybe the tower crane or temp power will go down during a generator test), coordinate timing with the GC to not, say, cut power when a concrete pour is in progress in a high-rise (bad day!). Also, many times other trades might still be finishing up when you’re commissioning – ensure the GC pushes them to not impede electrical rooms or to have their work done or safe during electrical tests (e.g., no wet painting near electrical gear during a test).
Commissioning Agent (CxA) or Engineer of Record: On many large projects, the owner hires a commissioning agent – an independent party who verifies systems operation. They will schedule functional tests that overlap with what we described, often requiring demonstrations or specific test forms to be filled. It’s crucial to coordinate with them: get their checklists in advance, attend commissioning meetings, and do a pre-commissioning to self-test everything before the formal witnessed test. With the commissioning agent, clarify responsibilities: for example, who will throw the breaker to simulate utility outage (often they ask the electrical contractor to do it under their observation). Also, they might require calibration certificates for equipment (like torque wrench calibration or meter calibration) – have those ready if needed. Build a good relationship – they are there to ensure quality, not to find faults, and working together makes the project shine to the owner.
Communication and Documentation: A key coordination element is communication logs. It can be helpful to have daily briefings during active commissioning with representatives from each involved trade to discuss what was tested, what issues found, and what’s next. Keep a log of any inter-trade issue – e.g., “Found that AHU-2 didn’t shut down on fire alarm – mechanical to check programming, electrical to verify wiring at relay XYZ.” Follow up in the next meeting. This ensures nothing falls through the cracks with “I thought they were fixing it” scenarios. Scheduling Tip: Commissioning often happens at the tail end when everyone is pushing to finish. Push to get as much pre-functional testing done early. For example, if floors 1-5 of a high-rise are mostly done, start commissioning there even while floors 10-15 are still being built above. Staggering it eases the crunch and also finds issues early enough to fix without delaying completion. Coordinate this schedule with other trades – maybe you can test the standpipe fire pump two weeks before final completion, which gives the sprinkler folks time to tweak things if needed. Coordination in Retrofits: In a tenant improvement, coordination might be simpler (fewer trades), but one critical coordination is with the building facilities management if the building is partially occupied. You must coordinate any testing that could affect existing tenants – for instance, if you need to shut down a panel that also feeds an occupied floor, schedule after hours and communicate through the facility manager. Often, doing a “commissioning light” for a retrofit – meaning testing what you can without killing anything critical – then scheduling one big outage to test transfer switches or tie-ins – is the approach. Clear communication via the building management to tenants (like “power will be out from 10pm to 2am on floor 12”) is crucial to avoid conflict or even legal issues. Summing up: Think of commissioning as a team sport. The electrical work might be the backbone, but without aligning with mechanical (the muscles) and fire alarm (the nerves), the building’s full body can’t function. A general foreman should lead by facilitating coordination meetings, clearly assigning responsibilities for test steps, and ensuring all parties are ready when it’s “game day” for final testing. This collaborative approach leads to a smoother inspection (because all systems pass together) and a satisfied client who sees a well-orchestrated effort rather than finger-pointing among trades.
Common Pitfalls and Solutions
Even experienced crews can stumble during the testing and commissioning phase. Here we highlight some common pitfalls/mistakes that occur in this phase of work, explain why they happen, and provide clear ways to avoid or resolve them:
Pitfall 1: Incomplete or Lost Documentation. It’s common that in the rush of construction, as-built drawings aren’t kept up to date, or test results get written on scrap paper and lost. Then when commissioning comes, you might be missing info like which breaker feeds a piece of equipment (if changes were made in the field), or you have no record of a megger test you did a month ago. Why it happens: Keeping documentation is tedious and often postponed, plus multiple people might be doing tests without a central log. Solution: Implement a documentation protocol early. Use a commissioning checklist and assign someone (often the foreman or a QA/QC person) to be the recorder. Even using a smartphone to take pictures of handwritten results and uploading to a shared folder can prevent loss. For drawings, have the installer mark up any changes on a paper or digital set as they go (sometimes called red-lines), which can then be turned over as as-builts. Make it clear that part of “done” for any task is updating the documentation. This way, when you start formal testing, you have a reliable reference. Additionally, make copies or backups of critical test results – don’t send the only notebook with an apprentice who might misplace it.
Pitfall 2: Not Following the Sequence (Ad Hoc Testing). Jumping around testing whatever is convenient rather than a logical sequence can lead to missed tests or duplicated effort. For example, energizing a panel before you tested insulation on its feeders, then having to de-energize it again when you realize you skipped that test. Why it happens: Lack of a plan, or pressure to get things running causes skipping ahead. Solution: Follow a defined sequence (like the step-by-step we outlined). Use checklists – literally check off each test as done. The general foreman should enforce that no system is energized until all prerequisite tests are done and documented. If something out-of-sequence must happen (say the owner demands some lights on early), treat that as an exception: do a mini-commissioning for that part (test it properly before energizing) and note that in your plan. Staying disciplined prevents oversight. Also, coordinate sequence with all trades so everyone is on the same page (avoid, e.g., mechanical starting equipment that electrical hasn’t finished testing).
Pitfall 3: Overconfidence – “No Need to Test, It’s New.” Sometimes people assume that because everything is new, it will work perfectly without thorough testing. For instance, skipping a megger test because “the cable is brand new, it’s fine,” or not function-testing every single transfer switch because “they’re all identical.” Why it happens: Time pressure and the false security that new = good. Also, fatigue at the end of a project can tempt a crew to cut corners. Solution: Remember that mistakes and manufacturing defects do occur. Emphasize a culture that testing is not optional – it’s required by code (as we showed with NEC 110.7 requiring wiring integrity tests)【51†L207-L214】 and by professional duty. One way to enforce this is to tie sign-offs to pay apps or milestones: e.g., the QA team must receive test results before final payment or before calling inspection. Another solution is involving a third-party testing firm for critical tests – they will test everything without bias. If overconfidence is an issue, share war stories (many experienced foremen have one: like that brand new breaker that was DOA and would have caused a major outage if not tested). Such examples remind the team why we test everything no matter what.
Pitfall 4: Coordination Failures – “I thought you did that!” In complex projects, something can fall through the cracks between trades. For example, the electrical team assumes the mechanical team tested an interlock, while mechanical assumed electrical did – result: it wasn’t tested at all. Or forgetting to schedule the fire alarm test with the fire marshal until the last minute. Why it happens: Poor communication, unclear division of responsibilities, or last-minute changes. Solution: Use a commissioning meeting or daily huddle to review all needed tests and who is responsible. Clearly document who does what in a commissioning plan (e.g., “Electrical will simulate power failure, Mechanical to verify all motors restart after power return, Fire Alarm contractor to verify signals,” etc.). Also, have a master checklist that includes all integrated tests and get sign-offs from each trade as they complete their part. If the project has a commissioning agent, leverage their process – they often issue pre-functional checklists to each trade, which helps delineate duties. Essentially, err on the side of over-communication. It’s better to hear “yes, we know, we have it covered” than to assume and find out it wasn’t covered.
Pitfall 5: Last-Minute Changes Not Communicated. Perhaps late in construction, an owner change or field change was made (e.g., swapped a breaker size, or moved a circuit to a different panel) and not everyone got the memo. If commissioning uses outdated drawings, you might test the wrong thing or miss something. Why it happens: Change management is challenging; sometimes informal changes happen that don’t make it to drawings by test time. Solution: The foreman should hold a “changes review” meeting right before commissioning begins, gathering any and all changes from the team, RFIs, or marked drawings. Update the testing documents accordingly. Encourage team members: if you installed something different from the original plan, speak up now – it’s far better than the inspector discovering an inconsistency. Also, during commissioning, keep flexibility – if a discrepancy is found (like a circuit labeled incorrectly), stop and trace it out; don’t ignore it. That trace might reveal the change that wasn’t recorded, and then you can adjust documentation and labeling.
Pitfall 6: Load Imbalance and Nuisance Trip Surprises. After powering up, sometimes breakers trip or unexpected load issues occur because the load was not evenly distributed or calculated correctly. Example: three phase panel feeding a bunch of single-phase servers all on Phase A – Phase A is overloaded while B and C are nearly idle, causing trips on A phase breaker. Or all the lighting in a store was on one circuit that ends up drawing more than 20A when fully on. Why it happens: During installation, balancing loads is sometimes overlooked, or actual loads differ from design (maybe the tenant plugged all heavy equipment into one area). Solution: Commissioning should include a balancing check – measure currents on each phase with most loads on. If imbalance is significant (rule of thumb: more than 10-15% difference between phases under normal operation), redistribute loads if possible (move some circuits to different phase breakers). In panels with spare circuits, this might be as easy as moving a breaker to a different phase stack. In other cases, it might need splitting circuits. To avoid this pitfall, during installation the foreman can plan circuit phase arrangement and note expected big loads per phase. Also, using a power quality analyzer for a day during commissioning can reveal if certain loads cause harmonics or surges that might trip breakers; then solutions like harmonic filters or different breaker settings can be implemented. Essentially, don’t assume balance – verify it.
Pitfall 7: Gear Commissioning Oversights. Modern switchgear, ATS, and breakers can have programming (like adjustable settings, or in ATS controllers: time delays). A common oversight is leaving factory default settings which may not coordinate with the system. E.g., an ATS might have a 5 minute engine cooldown default, but spec wanted 15 minutes – if not changed, the generator might shut off too soon. Why it happens: Forgetting to go through all settings in the rush, or not understanding the programming interface. Solution: Assign one person to be the “gear specialist” who systematically goes through each setting with the spec or manufacturer’s checklist. Many manufacturers have a startup sheet listing all adjustable parameters – use it. If uncertain, involve the manufacturer’s field engineer (for complex gear, they often include a startup service – coordinate to have them present). Always do a test after adjusting settings to see they take effect (for instance, set a genset time delay and then simulate a return of power to see if it waits the set time). Document the final settings in a table for record. This thoroughness prevents things like nuisance genset start-ups or breakers tripping below their intended value.
Pitfall 8: Safety Protocol Slips. Under schedule pressure, teams sometimes cut corners on safety during commissioning – for example, working on live panels because it’s “just a quick check,” or not wearing PPE because “I’m just tightening one screw.” This can lead to accidents, especially since during testing, people may be interacting with live systems more frequently. Why it happens: Schedule pressure, familiarity breeding contempt (“We’ve powered this panel a dozen times, no problem”), or discomfort with PPE. Solution: The safety culture must remain strong through the end of the project. In fact, commissioning can be more dangerous in some ways, because everything is energized and people are manipulating systems. Do a safety stand-down talk specifically about commissioning dangers (arc flash, etc.). Use a buddy system when doing potentially hazardous tests – e.g., one person throws a switch while another stands by in case of an issue, rather than one person alone in a room. Keep enforcing lockout/tagout: even though lots of toggling happens, if someone is working on a circuit, lock it out. The solution is to plan a bit more time for doing things safely – it’s always faster than dealing with an injury or damage. If an unsafe situation arises (like needing to open a live compartment), step back and get proper PPE or assistance rather than winging it.
Pitfall 9: Ignoring Small Issues (Postponing fixes). During commissioning you might find minor issues like a buzzing contactor, a slightly warm connector, a mislabeled plate. It’s tempting to say “we’ll fix that later” and focus on bigger problems. But later often gets forgotten, or minor issues cascade. That buzzing contactor could fail in a year, the warm connector could turn into a fire if not tightened. Why it happens: Human nature to prioritize big fires over small ones, and sometimes fatigue (“I am too tired to fix this tiny thing after dealing with the generator all day”). Solution: Maintain a running punch list (list of defects) with all issues, big or small. Assign someone to go through and close out each item. Encourage pride in workmanship – even if something will technically pass inspection, if it’s not right, fix it. A good strategy is to address easy fixes immediately – it gives a sense of progress and reduces the list. For slightly bigger fixes, schedule them within the next day or two of discovery. Don’t let the list stagnate until the very end; ideally, by the time the inspector comes, you’ve already rectified all known issues, so you’re confident there are no lingering problems. Sometimes pairing an apprentice with a journeyman to specifically attack punch list items each day can whittle it down effectively.
By being aware of these pitfalls in advance, a foreman can institute practices to avoid them. Commissioning is essentially about attention to detail and rigorous follow-through. Each mistake often comes from rushing or assumption. Therefore, fostering a culture of “check, check, and re-check – and fix it now” will turn those pitfalls into opportunities for the crew to demonstrate their thoroughness and professionalism. Remember, the goal is not just to pass inspection, but to deliver a safe, efficient system with no loose ends.
Advanced Techniques for Efficiency
Seasoned electrical foremen and experienced crews often develop advanced techniques and methods to perform testing and commissioning faster and more efficiently without compromising quality. These “tricks of the trade” help in managing time and labor, especially on large projects. Here are several such techniques, along with explanations and how to apply them:
Prefabricated Testing Kits and Temporary Setups: Smart foremen prepare standardized kits for common tests. For example, make a “continuity testing kit” – a small battery-buzzer device with leads that you can quickly connect at one end of a circuit, so an electrician at the other end just listens for a buzz instead of watching a meter. Some use a flashlight or buzzer tied into a circuit with a 9V battery – if the circuit is intact, the light goes on when you short at the far end. Similarly, create a “panel torque kit” with all needed bits preset on a torque screwdriver – instead of searching for the right bit each time, they’re all there. Application: These kits can be assembled early and carried job to job. They reduce the friction of setup time. Another example: have pre-printed torque label stickers ready; as soon as a panel is torqued, slap the label inside the door saying torque done on such date – saves time writing reports later.
Group Testing (Parallel Tasks): Large projects have hundreds of circuits. Instead of one team sequentially testing each, split into multiple teams to test in parallel. For instance, divide the building by floors or areas, each with a set of test gear. Make sure each team has a clear scope to avoid duplication or omission. Advanced tip: Use a common set of test forms in a cloud (like Google Sheets or a shared server) – as Team A completes circuits on floor 1, they tick them off in the sheet that Team B and C can also see. This prevents overlapping and allows the foreman to monitor progress in real time. On union jobs, manpower might be available to do this heavy parallel work – utilize it efficiently (it’s often more cost-effective to employ a few extra hands for one day to finish testing, than to drag it out over a week with fewer people).
Early Energization of Non-Critical Circuits: This is somewhat counterintuitive, but for efficiency, sometimes you energize portions of the system early (under controlled conditions) to expedite testing. For example, once a panel and its circuits test out fine, energize that panel even if the final inspection isn’t done yet (assuming it’s safe and allowed by the local AHJ under a temporary release). Then you can do things like thermal scanning under actual load, or let other trades start using permanent power instead of temporaries (which can reveal any issues with those circuits under real load). Caution: Only do this if proper permissions are in place (sometimes a utility will give temporary power approval). And ensure all safety measures – the panel should be complete with covers, etc. The advantage is you identify problems under real operation early, and you also reduce use of temporary generators or power which might be an extra cost.
Use of Software and Apps: Embrace digital tools. There are commissioning management software applications (like Procore, Bluebeam, or specific ones like CX Alloy) that let you track checklists and issues in a very organized way. An advanced foreman might use a tablet with drawings where each outlet or circuit can be checked off as tested. This saves the double handling of writing on paper then transferring to a report. Also, using barcode or QR code labels on equipment that link to test documents is a method used in some data centers – scan the QR on a panel and pull up its test results instantly. While not every project does this, being familiar with such tech can set Continuing with advanced efficiency techniques:
Leverage Software and Digital Plans: Many experienced foremen use software tools to expedite commissioning. For instance, using a tablet with the electrical drawings loaded and a stylus to mark checks as tests are done – this can later be saved as a testing record. Applications like Bluebeam or PlanGrid allow creating punch lists directly on drawings, which is faster than juggling spreadsheets and paper sketches. Example: You can place a colored dot on each outlet on the digital plan once it’s tested, so at a glance you see what’s left. Some teams use shared Google Sheets or specialized commissioning software to log results in real-time, which reduces double-entry of data. When and How: Implement this at the start of commissioning – do a quick training for the crew on how to update the digital log. This way, everyone can see updates live (useful for parallel testing teams). Non-union shops might still do a lot on paper; union contractors often invest in these tools as part of training, giving them an edge in efficiency.
Pre-Commissioning Meetings (“Dry Runs”): A savvy foreman will hold an internal meeting or even a simulation of the commissioning process before the actual event. They might walk the team through the sequence, assign roles, and even do a quick “rehearsal” of critical switching operations. This catches any confusion in procedure while not under the gun of an inspector watching. Efficiency Gain: When the real test happens, everyone knows their job – things go faster and smoother. It’s similar to a sports team doing a walkthrough before a game. It can be as informal as a huddle in the electrical room with the drawings, or as involved as having someone play the “inspector” role asking questions. The time invested (maybe an hour or two) pays off by eliminating pauses and missteps later.
Temporary Automation of Tests: For repetitive testing tasks, sometimes temporary rigs can automate things. Example: If you need to cycle a relay or breaker on and off many times (to test auto-transfer or something), instead of manually doing it, you can set up a small timer circuit to energize/de-energize a coil every 30 seconds. This frees technicians to observe results instead of manually toggling and watching simultaneously. Another example: using a data logger or power meter to record voltage dip and recovery during generator tests – rather than eyeballing it, the logger captures exact data which you can review. This is advanced in that it requires some electronics know-how, but union electricians often learn a bit of control circuitry that can be applied creatively for testing. Non-union crews might do more brute-force manual testing.
Crew Rotation to Manage Fatigue: Testing can be monotonous (imagine meggering hundreds of cables or toggling breakers all day). Fatigue can cause mistakes late in the day. An advanced technique is to rotate tasks among crew members to keep fresh eyes on the work. For instance, after two hours of doing continuity tests, swap that person to do labeling or documentation for a while, and let someone else continue the continuity tests. This not only helps catch errors (the new person might find a mistake the tired person missed) but also cross-trains everyone. Efficiency Benefit: Fewer errors to fix later, and maintaining a higher productivity rate by preventing burnout during the day. It requires planning so that everyone is familiar with all tasks.
Early Involvement of Inspectors or Consultants: A trick some foremen use in Chicago is to invite the inspector (informally) or a peer foreman to do a pre-inspection walk. If you have a good rapport, an inspector might walk the site off-the-record and point out any obvious code issues – giving you a chance to fix them before official inspection. Even if that’s not possible, having a fellow experienced foreman from another project walk your site can provide a fresh perspective. They might catch something you overlooked. It’s an advanced move because it leverages professional relationships and humility to have your work critiqued before it really counts. But it can save you from failing an inspection on something minor that an outside eye picks up.
Keep Spare Equipment Handy: Efficiency isn’t just speed – it’s also avoiding schedule slips. During commissioning, failures can happen. A pro move is to have spare parts on hand for critical items: an extra breaker or two of various sizes, spare fuses, an extra contactor coil, even a spare small transformer. If a component fails testing (say a breaker doesn’t trip properly, or a lighting contactor coil burns out), you can swap it out immediately and keep going, rather than waiting days for a replacement. Application: Identify critical path equipment and source spares in advance (often the project can return unused spares later or keep them as maintenance stock). Non-union contractors might be more hesitant to spend on spares; union contractors often have the backing to prioritize reliability – so use that to your advantage by being prepared.
These advanced techniques all aim at one thing: working smarter, not harder. They require foresight, sometimes creative thinking, and often draw on the collective wisdom of experienced tradespeople. By implementing them, a commissioning team can dramatically improve their efficiency – finishing the phase faster, with fewer errors, and less stress. Seasoned IBEW foremen often have a toolkit of such tricks, which they pass on to the next generation, keeping union labor at the forefront of productivity and quality.
IBEW Trade Secrets
Within the IBEW community, knowledge is power – and it’s freely shared among brothers and sisters. Over decades, union electricians have developed many “trade secrets” – clever methods or insider know-how that aren’t always found in textbooks. Here are some trade secrets relevant to testing and commissioning, along with guidance on when to use them and how they compare to practices in the non-union world:
The Neutral-Ground Trick for Continuity: A classic timesaver used by many union electricians is to use the neutral (grounded conductor) as a common return path for continuity tests. Here’s how it works: In a lighting or receptacle circuit, connect (tie) the hot and neutral together at the far end (in a device box). Then go to the panel and use an ohmmeter between hot and neutral – you’ll read a short (near zero ohms) if the circuit continuity is good. This way, one person can verify continuity without needing a second person at the far end holding a probe. When to use: On multi-wire branch circuits or any scenario where you have a neutral available and the circuit is de-energized. Trade secret tip: Some electricians will tie all the neutrals and grounds together temporarily in a j-box for a batch of circuits, allowing them to test multiple circuits quickly by checking each hot to ground back at the panel one by one. Just be absolutely sure to remove those temporary ties afterward! Non-union electricians may also know this trick, but union training often emphasizes safe ways to do it efficiently (e.g., using jumpers with bright flags so they’re not forgotten).
“Buzzing Out” Circuits with a Doorbell Transformer: Before modern tracing tools, a low-tech but effective method was to use a doorbell transformer and buzzer. Many an old-timer carries a 16V doorbell transformer in their kit. They’d hook it up to energize a circuit at low voltage and connect a buzzer or light at the other end. If it buzzes, the circuit is good. Essentially it’s a makeshift continuity tester that can handle long runs better than a little meter battery. Use: Long runs in a building where radio communication is tough – the audible buzzer at the end can be heard or the light seen easily. IBEW culture note: This is often passed down as a MacGyver-like trick – not found in manuals, but very handy. Non-union workers might not encounter this trick unless they had a mentor who used it.
Rapid Ground Fault Locator: Here’s a trick for finding the location of a short or ground fault in a long conduit run. Rather than meggering every segment, some experienced electricians do a “half-split” method: they open the circuit in the middle (if possible, e.g., at an intermediate pull box), then test which half the fault is on by megger or continuity. Then split that half and test again, basically binary-searching along the run. This can drastically cut down fault-finding time. When to use: When you suspect a nail nicked a wire or a conduit pinch causing a short, but the wire path is behind walls or in floors. Instead of pulling the whole thing out, the half-split method zeroes in on the suspect area. Union training in troubleshooting often covers this logical approach. In contrast, an inexperienced person might resort to yanking all wires out (labor intensive) or random guesswork. The systematic approach is a union “secret” to being efficient.
Torque Marking: A simple but effective “secret” for ensuring everything got torqued (and proving it) is to use a paint marker to mark each screw or lug after torquing to spec. This way, you can visually scan a panel and see that every connection has a mark, indicating it was done. When/how: Right after tightening to proper torque, put a dot or line of colored paint on the screw head or connector. If a screw is found without a mark, you know it needs attention. This practice is encouraged in union jobs (some specs even require it now) – it’s becoming more common outside too, but union crews adopting it early have saved countless hours of second-guessing. If an inspector questions a connection, you can say “see the torque mark – we torqued that.” Non-union electricians also do this, but it’s often at the behest of specific company QA policies. The “secret” here is consistency – union crews tend to be very consistent about it once it’s part of their routine.
Working with the Inspector, Not Against: A more cultural trade secret – but a very real one – is the value of building a respectful relationship with inspectors. Chicago’s electrical inspectors are often members or former members of the trade (or at least come from the industry), and IBEW foremen know that treating them as partners makes life easier. How this manifests: Seasoned foremen will sometimes call the inspector a few days before the official inspection to ask if there’s anything in particular they often see missed – a subtle way to get hints. Or they’ll ensure the site is clean and offer a genuine greeting and assistance (like having extra lighting or ladders ready for the inspector to use). This professional courtesy often results in a smoother inspection; if minor issues are found, the inspector knows this crew is competent and might allow a fix on the spot instead of writing a violation. Non-union contractors might also respect inspectors, but union contractors often have the advantage of a shared professional background which can foster mutual respect. The “secret” is simply good interpersonal skills and pride – part of the brotherhood knowledge is that your reputation follows you, so treat every inspection like an opportunity to show the quality of union work.
Mentorship and Information Network: Within the IBEW, there’s a strong culture of mentorship. Apprentices learn not just from formal classes but from war stories and tips their journeymen share on the job or at union meetings. This creates an informal information network. For instance, if a certain brand of breaker was found to have a factory issue, that info might circulate on the job wires (so other jobs double-check those breakers). Or if an inspector has a particular focus (say, really checks twist-out blanks in panels), the word gets around and everyone makes sure to double-check those. Non-union electricians rely on their company’s internal training or personal experience, which can vary greatly. The union “secret” here is collective experience – 1000 electricians sharing knowledge versus one electrician’s own experience. As a result, union crews can anticipate issues better.
Use of Specialty Union Resources: The IBEW/NECA community produces materials like the NECA Manual of Labor Units (to estimate labor) and the NJATC (now ETA) training guides which include best practices. A trade secret is that many union foremen will refer to NECA’s standards for quality control. For example, NECA has an installation standard for testing (NECA 90) that provides a comprehensive process – using that as a guideline is like having a cheat sheet for commissioning. While not secret, it’s underutilized outside union circles. When a foreman plans tests exactly as per NECA standards, it’s hard for anyone (GC or owner) to argue – it’s an authoritative source. Non-union folks might not even be aware of these documents or have access.
In comparing with non-union practices: none of these techniques are absolutely exclusive to union labor – a clever electrician anywhere might figure them out. However, the union advantage is a structured apprenticeship and brotherhood culture that actively shares these secrets and encourages using them. Non-union electricians might keep a clever trick to themselves as a way to secure their job (or simply have no avenue to share it widely). In IBEW, there’s pride in elevating the trade as a whole – if one crew discovers a better way, it often spreads to others through training classes or word-of-mouth at union meetings, safety seminars, etc. Brotherhood knowledge transfer is also about attitude: a willingness to teach and to learn. An apprentice is expected to ask “why are we doing it this way?” and a journeyman will explain the reasoning, perhaps relaying how they learned it from someone years ago. In a strong union jobsite, you’ll see a journeyman showing an apprentice a trick like using a bending spring to guide fish tape, or a foreman explaining how to placate a tough inspector – these intangible lessons are the trade’s secret sauce. To sum up, IBEW trade secrets in commissioning include practical testing hacks, troubleshooting methodologies, and the soft skills around inspections and teamwork. Knowing when and how to use them comes with experience: for example, use the neutral continuity trick only on isolated circuits and always remove jumpers after; use the half-split fault find only when you have accessible mid-points; approach inspectors once you’ve ensured your work is actually up to par (or it can backfire). The union’s emphasis on mentorship means these lessons are passed on, keeping union electricians a step ahead in both craftsmanship and savvy. As the saying goes on the job: “Work smart, look out for each other, and never stop learning.” That’s the IBEW way.
Quality Control Checklist
Before calling for the official inspection, every electrical foreman should run through a comprehensive quality control (QC) checklist to verify that the installation and documentation are 100% ready. This final self-audit can catch any lingering issues and ensure a smooth inspection. Below is a checklist of items electricians should verify:
All Labels and Directories in Place: Every panelboard has a complete and up-to-date circuit directory (printed or neatly handwritten in pencil) affixed inside the door 【21†L1-L4】. All disconnect switches, junction boxes, and device plates are labeled as required (e.g., “FEEDER 3 FROM PANEL DP-1” on a j-box, or “Emergency” on life safety circuit equipment). Wire tags are on all circuit conductors in panels and pull boxes per project standard. Labels should be legible and durable (not paper tags that can fall off).
Torque Verification Completed: All electrical connections have been torqued to manufacturer’s specifications (per NEC 110.14(D) requirements) and there is evidence of it – for example, each lug or screw has a torque mark (colored dot) or a sign-off sheet is completed. Especially check big lugs on bus bars, breaker terminals, neutrals in panelboards, mechanical lugs in lighting fixtures, and any field-assembled equipment connections. If not already done, use a calibrated torque wrench/driver now to tighten and mark each connection.
Insulation Resistance Test Results Acceptable: Insulation (megger) tests have been performed on all feeders, service entrance conductors, and long runs or critical circuits. Ensure that the recorded values are above the minimum acceptable (often project spec says >50 MΩ for 1 minute at 1000V, for instance). If any results were marginal, those have been addressed (replaced cable or redried if moisture issue) and re-tested. It’s good to have a summary of megger results printed out or in the logbook in case the inspector asks.
Grounding and Bonding Continuity: All required grounding and bonding connections are installed and tight. Using an ohmmeter, verify near-zero resistance between ground bars and metal enclosures, between equipment ground conductors and the main ground, etc., especially on things like isolated ground receptacles (where both iso and regular grounds should eventually bond at the service). Grounding electrode system is complete: if there are ground rods, they are bonded and (if required) a test was done or the second rod is in place【45†L88-L96】. Check bonds to building steel, water pipes, and other electrodes – they should be connected and labeled. In Chicago, ensure metal conduits are properly bonded (e.g., bonding bushings on concentric KO’s where required, etc.).
Breaker/Fuse Sizes and Settings Correct: Walk through each panel and piece of equipment and compare breaker and fuse sizes to the schedule or one-line diagram. Are all overcurrent protection devices the correct amp rating and class? No “temporary” breakers left in (for example, sometimes a higher rating might be installed during construction for testing and intended to be swapped down – make sure that got swapped). For adjustable breakers and relays: verify long/short/inst settings, ground fault settings, UV relay pickup, etc., match the coordination study or engineer’s settings sheet. This might be in a binder as well – have that document handy to show how each was set. Also check any multi-tap transformers or power supplies – are they tapped to the correct voltage (it’s easy to leave a control transformer on 480V tap when it’s fed 208V, etc.).
GFCI/AFCI Protection Verification: All required GFCI devices (receptacles and breakers in bathrooms, rooftops, kitchens, outdoors, etc.) are installed and tested using the test button and an external GFCI tester. They should trip and disconnect power, and reset properly. Document that each was tested. Similarly, AFCI breakers (if applicable by code in the dwelling units or hotel rooms, etc., or if Chicago exceptions used, note that) are in place and tested with their built-in test button. No circuits that require AFCI/GFCI are accidentally on a standard breaker.
Emergency Systems Checks: If there are emergency or standby power systems: ensure exit signs and emergency lights are functioning (bulbs all lit, batteries charged). Do a 90-minute battery test on emergency lights (either by killing power or using the test switch) – required by code to ensure they last, and good to do before inspection so you can replace any failing batteries. Confirm any emergency circuit is separated per code (no non-emergency loads mixed in) – the inspector may trace conduit or wiring to verify. All transfer switches should have been test-operated; check that indicating lights on them (Source Available, Source Connected) work and that any bypass/isolation switches are in the normal position. If fire pump or life safety feeders require special labeling (“Fire Pump Circuit – Do Not Disconnect”), make sure those plaques are up.
Panelboard and Equipment Covers Installed: All panels have their deadfronts and trim covers in place with all screws installed. No missing blanks in panel covers (open holes must be filled with breaker blanks). All junction boxes and device boxes have covers or devices on them (none left open or with tape as temporary cover). Essentially, the electrical installation should look 100% complete – an inspector will flag open enclosures for sure. If certain covers need to be off for the inspection to show internal work, coordinate that (generally, it’s better to leave them on for a safe inspection unless asked).
Cleanliness and Workmanship: The equipment should be clean – wipe down panels and gear of dirt, wipe off fingerprints from stainless steel covers, etc. Why does this matter? It gives the impression of a thorough job and sometimes inspectors equate cleanliness with care. Also, remove any debris inside panels (wire clippings, bits of insulation). All wire terminations should be neat with no stray strands poking out. Cable gutter spaces not overfilled (if they look crammed, inspector might question fill even if technically within limit). If using tie-wraps or lacing on conductors, they are tidy and not strangling wires (snug but not cutting).
Working Space and Safety Signs: Verify that the required working clearance (typically 3 feet or more depending on voltage) is clear in front of all electrical equipment. No pipes or ducts encroach in the dedicated space above panels (NEC 110.26). In Chicago’s context, also ensure emergency disconnect locations and required signage (like the service disconnect marked “SERVICE DISCONNECT” and address placards if needed) are in place. Check that “Electrical Room” doors have signage if required, and any “High Voltage – Keep Out” signs for gear above 600V. Also, any barrier or bollards protecting equipment (like a transformer) from vehicle damage are installed if needed.
Testing Documentation Prepared: Have a binder or folder with all relevant documentation ready for the inspector or for project closeout: megger test results, ground test result or second rod note, torque log, commissioning forms (if an agent is involved), manufacturer start-up reports (sometimes required for warranty, e.g., a generator start-up sheet by the tech), and as-built one-line diagram. Also include copies of any special approvals or variances if applicable. In Chicago, sometimes the inspector might want to see the affidavit of supervision (the supervising electrician’s assurance that work was done to code) – ensure any paperwork like that is signed and available.
Remove Temporary Devices: Any temporary wiring or jumpers used for construction or testing should be removed. For example, temporary lights, provisional power feeds, or test jumpers in control circuits (often installers put a temporary jumper in a control circuit to simulate a contact that wasn’t ready – all those must be out now). Also remove lockout tags that are no longer needed and restore circuits to normal operation (unless they are to remain off until occupancy). Basically, transition the site from “under construction” to “ready for operation.”
Final Walk with Fresh Eyes: If possible, have a crew member who was less involved do a fresh walk-through, imagining they are the inspector. Sometimes a new set of eyes catches something like a missing connector or a wire that got nicked and taped but should have been replaced. Use a flashlight to peek in corners. Check ceiling for any forgotten junction box above T-bar without cover, etc. This “peer review” is part of QC.
This checklist (which can be expanded based on specific project needs) serves as a safeguard to ensure nothing critical is missed. It’s much better to catch and fix issues yourself than to have them pointed out in an official inspection or, worse, to leave a hazard in place. A good general foreman treats this QC step with as much importance as the official inspection – it’s effectively a self-inspection. When all items above are verified, you can approach the real inspection with confidence, and you significantly increase the chances of a first-pass approval with zero punch-list items from the inspector.
NECA Labor Units Reference
Accurately predicting and managing the labor required for testing and commissioning is crucial for project scheduling and profitability. The NECA Manual of Labor Units (2023) provides benchmark labor units for various electrical tasks, including certain testing and verification activities. Here we summarize some key labor unit data for testing-phase tasks and discuss how to use this data:
Typical Labor Units for Testing Tasks (Average Conditions):
Continuity Testing: Approximately 0.05 hours per connection for straightforward continuity checks in “Normal” conditions. For example, ringing out one branch circuit end-to-end might be rated around 3 minutes of labor. So if you have 100 circuits to test, a baseline labor would be 5 hours for continuity testing (this might assume one worker; two workers could halve the elapsed time but same total man-hours).
Insulation Resistance (Megger) Testing: Roughly 0.1–0.2 hours per conductor termination, or per 100 feet of cable, under normal conditions. NECA might not give a very granular number, but in practice contractors use about 0.5 hour for a typical feeder (including setup, testing all conductors phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground, and teardown). So our quick reference of 0.5 hours per feeder is in line with that.
Panelboard Functional Check: On average 1.5 hours per panel for a standard 42-circuit panel – this includes checking wiring, torquing, and testing breakers. If conditions are ideal (panel is organized and no issues), it might be less; if it’s a complex panel or in a tight space, more. NECA might give something like 1.0 hour for a panel in normal conditions just to terminate wires; adding testing makes it ~1.5.
Large Equipment Testing (e.g. Generator/ATS):* NECA’s book may not explicitly list “commission generator,” but based on similar tasks, you can expect 4–8 hours of labor for a full test involving a generator and transfer switch. We listed 4.0 in the JSON as an average for the electrical portion (setting up load bank, running test, etc.), but if you include coordination and waiting time, it can be more. For scheduling, assume maybe one work day with a two-person team for a full-on generator commissioning including safety tests (so 16 hours total).
Grounding System Test: Perhaps 4 hours total for a fall-of-potential test on a simple system (including setup and teardown of stakes), as a ballpark. However, many contractors skip this by driving two rods, so labor goes into installing the second rod (which NECA does list – for a ground rod maybe ~0.5 hr to drive, depending on conditions).
Adjustment Factors (Height, Difficulty, etc.): NECA labor units come with the concept of “Normal”, “Difficult”, “Most Difficult” conditions【53†L127-L135】. The above numbers assume normal conditions: new building, adequate access, and no extraordinary challenges. If you are testing in a crowded mechanical room (tight access – a “Difficult” condition), or an operating facility at night (added difficulty), you need to apply factors. For example, NECA might suggest increasing labor by 25% or more for difficult conditions. Height: as NECA notes, work over 10 ft might add 5% per additional 5 ft or so【53†L169-L177】 – in testing, if you have to go up in a lift repeatedly to megger bus duct or overhead cable tray, factor that in (setup of the lift, etc., adds time). If an area is occupied (meaning you have to work around people or off-hours), that also reduces efficiency – possibly moving you from “Normal” to “Difficult” category.
Material Handling and Setup Time: Testing tasks often have a lot of setup/tear-down (bringing equipment, connecting, disconnecting). NECA labor units generally include normal material handling in the installation figures【1†L1-L8】, but for commissioning, consider that as part of your labor. For instance, moving a heavy load bank or multiple trips to bring test gear to a 40th floor adds time. Those aren’t directly in labor tables, so estimators add them as separate line items or increased difficulty factor.
Tracking Labor Against Estimates: As commissioning progresses, a foreman should track how many hours are spent versus how many were budgeted (from the estimate which likely used NECA units or similar). If continuity testing took 8 hours but was estimated for 5 (perhaps conditions were harder, or team was learning), note that variance. Tracking allows you to manage the remaining tasks – maybe allocate more crew or time if you see testing is trending over budget. Conversely, if you finish something in less time, you can reassign labor to other tasks. This is essentially project controls. Many union contractors use NECA units as the baseline for their project budgets, so by comparing actual hours to NECA hours, you can gauge productivity. It’s important to log any reasons if there’s a discrepancy (e.g., “spent extra 4 hours tracing a fault – not in original scope”) so that information can be fed back to estimators or used in change orders if appropriate.
Using Labor Data for Scheduling: The commissioning plan should incorporate these labor units to predict how long each activity will take and thus schedule accordingly. For example, if you have 200 circuits to test (continuity and megger) and 10 panels to check, plus a generator test, you might sum up: (200 * 0.05 = 10 hours) + (let’s say 20 feeders * 0.5 = 10 hours) + (10 panels * 1.5 = 15 hours) + (generator 8 hours) = ~43 hours of work. If you have a team of 4 electricians dedicated, that’s roughly a bit more than one day’s work; but in reality, due to coordination and some tasks needing to be sequential, you might spread it over 2-3 days. Having these numbers lets you create a realistic schedule and avoid the pitfall of underestimating time needed (which could lead to rushing or skipping tests). It also helps in communicating with the GC/owner – you can justify that “we need X days for commissioning” based on industry-standard labor figures, not just a guess.
Labor Units for Documentation and Correction: Don’t forget to allocate labor for fixing issues found during commissioning and for producing documentation. NECA units mostly cover installation tasks. Commissioning often reveals some items to correct – an estimator might include an allowance, say 5% of total install hours, for “testing and troubleshooting”. If issues are minimal, you gain that time; if there are many, you might consume it. Managing your labor so that this allowance is not exceeded is key – if you burn too much time on rework, it can blow the budget. By tracking issues (as mentioned in pitfalls) you can also support any claims for extra work if something was beyond scope.
Example Averages:
Light Fixture Testing: While not usually broken out, if you had to functionally test emergency ballasts in 100 light fixtures, and NECA says 0.2 hr to install a fixture normally, you might estimate 0.05 hr each just to test the ballast (so 5 hours total) – and indeed, you can probably get it done in that time if organized (maybe 2 guys, 2.5 hours).
Receptacle Testing: Plugging in a tester on, say, 300 receptacles – might take 1-2 minutes each including walking time (so 0.02-0.03 hr each). That’s around 6-10 hours total – a one-person job for a day. That sounds trivial, but if not scheduled, it could become a last-minute crunch.
These small tasks add up, and labor units help ensure they’re accounted for.
In summary, NECA labor units provide a benchmark:
Use them to set your initial plan (how many hours tasks should take under average conditions).
Adjust with appropriate factors for job-specific conditions (height, existing building, complexity – NECA’s “Difficult” or “Most Difficult” columns if applicable【53†L147-L155】【53†L156-L164】).
Monitor actual hours expended versus these units to keep the project on track. If you see a particular task is trending over unit, you can investigate why – maybe the conditions were harder than thought, or the crew needs guidance, or the estimate was off.
Feedback loop: After the project, review the labor performance. If testing a data center took 20% more hours than NECA suggested, document those reasons. This becomes institutional knowledge for future estimates – maybe data centers always run a bit higher due to stricter testing requirements (thus next time, use “Difficult” column).
Using labor unit references smartly means you allocate sufficient time for quality work without grossly overestimating (which keeps bids competitive). It’s a balance. A union general foreman often has the benefit of historical labor data from similar jobs via their contractor – essentially labor units adjusted by that contractor’s experience (as NECA suggests: factor in the company’s ability)【53†L129-L137】. As you grow in experience, you’ll develop a sense of when you can beat the book (do it faster than NECA) or when the job is so tough that even NECA’s toughest category might be underestimated. Ultimately, labor units are a planning tool – they don’t replace real-time decision making, but they greatly enhance it. By referencing NECA 2023 data throughout the commissioning phase, you ensure that your crew’s effort aligns with expectations and that the project stays on schedule and budget while achieving a thorough, uncompromised testing process.
