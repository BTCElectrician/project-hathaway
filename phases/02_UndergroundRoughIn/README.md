Site Preparation & Underground Rough-In (Commercial Electrical Phase)
Code References (NEC & Chicago Codes)
NEC Burial Depths: The National Electrical Code (NEC) Article 300.5 specifies minimum cover requirements for underground conduits. For example, PVC conduit generally requires 18 inches of cover in earth (per Table 300.5)​
ECMWEB.COM
. Rigid metal conduit (RMC) or intermediate metal conduit (IMC) can be as shallow as 6 inches cover due to their greater durability​
OAK-FOREST.ORG
. These depths ensure protection from damage (and must be increased in vehicular areas or reduced if under concrete slabs, as detailed in NEC Table 300.5​
ECMWEB.COM
). Where conduits are subject to physical damage (e.g. emerging from grade or near traffic), Schedule 80 PVC or metal conduit is required by code​
ECMWEB.COM
 for extra strength.
Grounding Electrode (Ufer Ground): NEC 250.52(A)(3) mandates a concrete-encased electrode (the “Ufer” ground) for new buildings. This means at least 20 feet of rebar (½ inch diameter) or a #4 AWG bare copper wire is bonded and embedded in the concrete footing that’s in direct contact with earth​
ECMAG.COM
. In practice, one typically ties a #4 bare copper to the rebar cage of the foundation (with an NEC-listed clamp or exothermic weld) before the pour, creating a robust grounding electrode.
Chicago Electrical Code: Chicago’s local code (2018 Chicago Electrical Code, Title 14E) is based on the 2017 NEC with some stricter provisions​
CHICAGO.GOV
. Chicago generally requires metallic raceways for all wiring methods in commercial buildings​
CHICAGO.GOV
. Non-metallic conduits (PVC) are allowed underground in certain cases, but often Chicago jobs use PVC for direct burial only when sufficiently deep (18″ or more) and transition to RMC for risers or where entering/exiting grade​
OAK-FOREST.ORG
. Also, NM cable is not allowed in Chicago, so all wiring even later will be in conduit. Always check Chicago amendments – for instance, in the City of Chicago, all feeders entering a building must be in RMC/IMC once above grade.
Other Applicable Codes: NEC Article 352 covers PVC conduit usage (confirming it is allowed for direct burial if sunlight-resistant and marked, per 352.10, with proper burial depth)​
ECMWEB.COM
. NEC 300.5(D) requires protection for underground raceways emerging from the ground (rigid metal or Schedule 80 PVC). Additionally, ensure any underground junction boxes or handholes are accessible per NEC 314.29 (can’t be buried permanently). Hospitals must follow NEC Article 517 (e.g. separation of normal and emergency circuits), meaning you might install separate dedicated underground conduits for emergency feeders in health care projects. Always consult the latest NEC and any local code amendments for specific requirements on things like conduit fill, derating for underground runs, and separation from other utilities.
Installation Guide (Step-by-Step)
Overview: Underground rough-in is the first major installation phase – it sets the stage for all electrical systems. You’ll be laying conduit runs in trenches or slabs, installing ground electrodes, and coordinating with concrete pours. Precision at this stage is critical because mistakes are literally buried in the ground (expensive to fix later). Below is a step-by-step guide:
Plan & Layout: Review the electrical site drawings and one-line diagrams thoroughly. Identify all underground runs – service feeders, distribution conduits, stub-ups for equipment, floor boxes, and sleeves for future systems. Mark the locations on site using spray paint or stakes (often color-coded paint: red for electric). In Chicago high-rises or hospitals, use a laser level or GPS/total station (Hilti PLT) to pinpoint exact stub-up locations within the foundation – accuracy now saves headaches later. Before any digging, call 811 (JULIE in Illinois) to locate and mark existing utilities​
ENGINEERCALCS.COM
. Nothing halts a job faster than hitting a gas line or telecom duct! Coordinate the layout with the general contractor and other trades to avoid conflicts (e.g. don’t put your conduit where plumbing needs to go).
Excavation & Trenching: Once locations are set, excavate the trenches to the required depth (per code and plans). Use excavation crews or equipment as needed – on union jobs, an Operating Engineer will run the backhoe, while Laborers may do hand-digging. Ensure trenches are wide enough for the conduit bundle (duct bank) plus required spacing. Trench Safety: if trenches are deeper than ~5 feet or in unstable soil, shoring or trench boxes must be used for worker safety (OSHA rules). Keep the trench bottom as level as possible and at correct elevation. Remove any large rocks or debris in the trench bottom (these can damage conduit)​
ENGINEERCALCS.COM
. For large duct banks (e.g. 8x4” conduits for a 3000A service), you may step the trench or have a wider profile to accommodate all conduits in one layer. Use transit or laser level to check trench depth along the run. If groundwater is present, dewater the trench (pumps or well points) to keep it dry while working​
ENGINEERCALCS.COM
. Proper trench prep (smooth, level bed) prevents issues later.
Bedding & Base Prep: Before laying conduit, add a few inches of sand or fine gravel bedding to the trench bottom​
ENGINEERCALCS.COM
. This bedding cushions the conduits and allows fine adjustment. Compact and level the bedding gently. The goal is a uniform, rock-free base so conduits won’t be stressed or cracked by hard points​
ENGINEERCALCS.COM
. For direct burial (non-encased) installations, this sand bed is critical. In Chicago winters, if doing this in freezing conditions, make sure the base material isn’t frozen clumps – you may need to warm it or use ground heaters/blankets so the trench doesn’t frost heave.
Conduit Assembly & Laying: Install the conduits according to the layout:
Material Selection: Use PVC Schedule 40 conduit for most underground runs in open ground (cost-effective and easy to assemble). For any segments subject to damage (exposed stub-ups, etc.), use PVC Schedule 80 or RMC. Often, PVC conduits will transition to galvanized rigid metal conduit (RMC) where they emerge from the ground or enter a building wall for added protection (Chicago practice is to stub up in RMC). Make sure to have the correct size and type of conduits as per plan (e.g. 4″ for service feeders, 2″ for generator feeders, 3/4″ or 1″ for branch circuits to light poles, etc.).
Joining Conduits: If using PVC, cut to length with a saw or PVC cutter, deburr the ends (an Ideal conduit reamer or utility knife works), then apply PVC primer and cement. Bottom out each joint with a 1/4 turn twist to evenly spread cement, and hold for a few seconds to set – nothing worse than a conduit “popping” back out. Follow the cement curing time per the glue manufacturer (e.g. Oatey PVC cement might set in minutes, but in cold weather give it more time).
Multiple Conduits: When running multiple conduits in parallel (a duct bank), maintain spacing between conduits (typically about 2-3″ apart or per spec). Use plastic conduit spacers or saddles at intervals to keep the conduits aligned and evenly separated. This also helps if the duct bank will be encased in concrete, ensuring proper concrete surround. Large duct banks may be built in layers; if so, stagger the joints between layers and tie conduits together with rebar wire temporarily so they act as one assembly.
Bending & Routing: Utilize factory-made long radius elbows for turns (especially for primary feeds). For example, a 36″ radius 90° PVC elbow for a 4″ conduit makes wire pulling easier than a tight field bend. Where field bends are needed in metal conduit, use a hydraulic bender (e.g. a Greenlee 881 for rigid up to 2″, or factory-made sweeps for larger). Ensure no section has more than 360° of bends between pull points (NEC requirement) – if it would, plan a manhole or pull box. Use offsets/kicks as needed to line up stub-ups with equipment pads or wall penetrations (a classic “Chicago bend” – a 30°-60° kick – might align a conduit to a panel stub). Check each bend with a level or template to keep it uniform across a duct bank.
Stub-Ups and Terminations: As conduits approach stub-up points (like where they’ll enter switchgear, transformers, floor boxes, etc.), ensure you transition to RMC or IMC if required by spec or code (often done 6″ to 1′ before emerging from floor). Threaded PVC-to-RMC adapters (male adapters) can be used to connect PVC to a threaded rigid elbow for the vertical portion. Set the vertical conduits (stub-ups) accurately: use a tape measure and laser to get the right position and height. They should extend sufficiently above the pour or slab to attach to equipment later (better to leave extra length; you can cut down later). Group stub-ups using a layout template if multiple are coming through a slab so they match the equipment knockouts or box openings. Cap all conduit ends during this phase – use plastic caps or duct tape to prevent concrete, dirt, or water from entering. It’s easy for debris to get in, and you won’t notice until trying to pull wire later.
Concrete Encasement (if required): Some projects (like data centers or hospital feeders) require concrete-encased duct banks. Once conduits and spacers are in place, support the assembly on rebar chairs or bricks to raise it off the trench bottom the specified distance (so concrete flows underneath). Typically, a red dye is added to the concrete encasing electrical conduits as a warning indicator. Ensure the conduits are secured against floating – PVC is buoyant in wet concrete. You may tie the duct bank to driven rebar stakes or the formwork. During the pour, have electricians on hand to monitor that conduits remain in place and stub-ups remain plumb and correctly spaced.
Backfilling: If not encasing in concrete, after conduit installation you will backfill the trench in layers. First, put 6 inches of sand or fine fill over the conduits (this is the “initial backfill” up to 12″ above the pipe)​
ENGINEERCALCS.COM
. This protects the conduits from larger rock damage. Next, install a warning tape 1–1.5 ft above the conduits (e.g. a 3M underground warning tape that says “CAUTION – ELECTRIC LINE BURIED BELOW”). This brightly colored tape will be a warning if someone digs in the future. Continue backfilling with excavated soil (or granular fill if specified), in lifts (~6-12″), and compact each layer properly (especially under future slabs or roads to prevent settlement). Avoid large rocks directly on conduits – sift them out. For long straight runs of PVC, consider expansion gaps if temperature swings are extreme (thermal expansion can be significant in PVC; an expansion fitting may be used if required by temperature change calculations).
Slab-on-Grade Coordination: If conduits are being laid within or under a slab (like branch conduits for floor boxes in a hospital lab or a high-rise’s parking level), coordinate with the concrete crew. Conduits in slab should be installed after rebar is in place. Secure conduits to the rebar (nylon tie wraps or tie-wire) so that they don’t move when concrete is poured. Maintain required clearance between conduit and rebar (usually not an issue unless conduit bundle is large). Make sure the top of conduit will have the required concrete cover above (code often requires 3″ concrete cover for conduits in slabs in contact with earth). For floor boxes, attach them firmly to the formwork or rebar and double-check elevations so the box will be flush with finished floor. Again, cap everything and keep it clean.


Site crews assembling a multi-conduit duct bank before concrete encasement. Note the conduits laid in a trench with spacers, soon to be encased in red concrete for protection. Large projects (like data centers or hospitals) often use such duct banks to route feeders between buildings or to transformers.
Grounding System Installation: Alongside the conduits, the grounding electrode system must be installed during site prep. In commercial projects, this typically includes:
Concrete-Encased Electrode (Ufer): As mentioned, bond a #4 AWG bare copper wire to the rebar in footing (usually at least 20′ length run along the footing). This wire’s end should stub out of the concrete (typically into the electrical room) for connection to the main grounding bar. Ensure the rebar connection is tight and accessible for inspection​
ECMAG.COM
. This is usually done prior to the foundation pour – coordinate with the rebar crew.
Ground Rods: If specified or if the soil needs additional electrodes, drive ground rods around the building foundation. A common approach is to install 5/8″ x 8′ copper-clad ground rods in undisturbed earth outside the foundation, spaced at least 6 feet apart (per NEC 250.53). On a large site, you might have a series of ground rods or a ground ring (bare copper loop around the building footing) for a data center. Use a hammer drill with a ground rod driver bit or a jackhammer to drive rods to flush or below grade. After driving, connect them using an irreversible clamp or exothermic weld. Bond all ground electrodes together – water pipe, building steel, Ufer, ground rods – into one system.
Bonding: Ensure any metal underground structures (like rigid conduit, steel I-beams in foundations, etc.) are bonded. If you have metallic conduit stub-ups, they’ll be bonded through fittings to the panels later; just ensure continuity now (threaded connections tight, use bonding jumpers on concentric KO fittings if required).
Inspection & Documentation: Before you conceal any of this work (backfill or pour concrete), schedule the required inspections. In Chicago and most jurisdictions, an underground inspection must be passed with the trench open and conduits visible​
OAK-FOREST.ORG
. The inspector will check depths, conduit types, spacing, proper strapping/support, correct materials (e.g. UL-listed conduits, proper color of primer on PVC joints), and that the grounding electrode (Ufer) is in place. Have your permits and plans on site for the inspector to reference. It’s wise to also take photographs of the installations for your records (some GCs require a photo log of underground utilities). Once signed off, you can proceed to backfill or pour.
Backfill & Pour: After inspection approval, carefully backfill trenches as described, or if in slab, proceed with the concrete pour. For duct banks that will be concrete-encased, coordinate a concrete pour just like a small footing: use the specified mix (often 3000 psi with red dye) and vibrate the concrete to eliminate voids around conduits. Ensure your crew keeps an eye on those stub-ups during the pour – they can shift if not secure. Finish the top of encased duct banks if they’ll be below grade (often they’ll be buried after). For slabs, electricians should be present during the pour to adjust any floor boxes or conduits that get jostled and to trowel around conduit openings if needed. Once concrete sets, your underground rough-in is essentially complete.
Post-Pour / Post-Backfill Tasks: After backfilling, compacting, or the slab curing, do a quality check. Make sure all conduit stub-ups are clear of debris (run a fish tape or even a mandrel through critical conduits to ensure they didn’t collapse or clog). It’s easier to fix now than later. Remove any temporary caps and install proper bushings on metal conduit ends (NEC 300.4(F) requires bushings on conduits with #4 AWG or larger conductors, which will be typical for feeders). You might also measure megger or continuity on any grounding conductor installed (for example, test that your Ufer ground connection shows continuity to the rebar by using a multimeter – often the concrete’s still green so you might get a reading through the tie wire network). Secure any above-grade stub-ups with temporary supports if they’ll be exposed for a while (a stub sticking out of soil can get hit – maybe put a steel stake and tape to it). Finally, update your as-built drawings with any changes made in the field (e.g. if you had to route a conduit differently to avoid an unforeseen obstacle, document it). This completes the underground rough-in phase, setting the stage for the above-ground rough installation.
Materials Deep Dive (Specs & Brands)
A successful underground install uses the right materials. Below is a deep dive into key materials, including some trusted brands commonly used in Chicago’s commercial projects:
Conduit & Raceway: For underground runs, PVC conduit (Polyvinyl Chloride, usually Schedule 40) is standard for direct burial or concrete encasement due to its corrosion resistance and low cost. Example: Carlon or Cantex PVC Schedule 40, in sizes from 3/4″ up to 6″ trade size. Where higher strength is needed (exposed portions, or per Chicago code requirements), use Galvanized Rigid Metal Conduit (GRC) or Intermediate Metal Conduit (IMC) – e.g. Allied or Wheatland Tube brand steel conduit. GRC is heavy galvanized steel conduit, threaded, very robust (and Chicago often mandates it for anything above grade). Rigid Nonmetallic Conduit (RNC) like PVC Schedule 80 is a thick-wall PVC used when nonmetallic is allowed but extra protection is needed (for example, emerging from ground in a parking lot – some specs call for Sch80 for the first 6 feet). Another option occasionally used is RTRC (Fiberglass conduit) such as Champion Fiberglass – lightweight and corrosion-proof, sometimes used in long underground runs (NEC Article 355 covers it)​
ECMAG.COM
, but less common in Chicago projects compared to PVC and RMC.
Conduit Fittings: These include couplings, elbows, adapters, and bushings:
PVC fittings: Use PVC solvent-weld couplings for straight joins and factory 90° or 45° elbows for turns. Carlon makes standard radius elbows. For transitioning PVC to metal, use PVC male adapters to threaded hubs. Keep some PVC expansion joints on hand – if a long run crosses an area with big temperature swings or structural movement, an expansion fitting (e.g. Kraloy expansion joint) allows ~4″ of movement.
Metal conduit fittings: All GRC/IMC joints are threaded – use threaded couplings (standard or three-piece unions if you can’t turn the pipe). RACO and O-Z/Gedney are well-known brands for conduit fittings in Chicago; for instance, RACO’s threaded couplings and insulated bushings are commonly used. Insulating bushings (plastic lined or phenolic) are required on the ends of conduits containing larger conductors to protect wire insulation – e.g. a RACO insulating bushing on a 4″ RMC stub-up feeding a switchboard. If conduits enter an outdoor pull box or vault, use sealing locknuts or washers to keep water out. Have plenty of lockrings, chase nipples, and reducing bushings for adapting conduit sizes at entries.
Conduit Supports: During layout, you might need temporary stakes or strap ties. Hilti makes handy conduit clamps and anchors. For example, Hilti adjustable steel banding can strap conduits to rebar or formwork. Not permanent materials, but worth noting as aids.
Underground Boxes & Enclosures: If the plans call for pulling points underground or stub-ups for future use, you might use handholes or junction boxes. Concrete handhole boxes (precast vaults) with steel covers are common for electrical distribution – these might be specified for large cable pulls or telecom. For smaller branches or lighting circuits, heavy-duty fiberglass handholes (e.g. Quazite brand) can be used. In a warehouse scenario, if a conduit stubs up outside, it may terminate in a NEMA 3R junction box or pull box above grade – RACO or Hoffman steel NEMA-rated boxes are typical. Ensure boxes are labeled and sized per code (NEC 314.28 for pull box sizing if large conductors). Also consider floor boxes for slab embeds: e.g. RACO or Appleton cast-iron floor boxes for putting receptacles in a concrete floor – these would be set during underground rough in.
Grounding Components: Key materials for the grounding electrode system include:
Ground Rods: Usually copper-clad steel, 5/8″ diameter × 8′ length is standard. Erico (now part of Pentair) is a major brand, known for Cadweld and ground rods. These rods are driven into earth and will need acorn clamps or Cadweld connections.
Grounding Conductors: Typically #4 AWG bare copper for building ground electrode conductor (per code, 4 AWG is minimum for Ufer ground connection​
MIKEHOLT.COM
). Also #4 or #2 AWG bare copper for any ground ring or bonding between rods (size per NEC 250.66 depending on service size). Use proper ground clamps: for attaching to rebar (Ufer), use a listed rebar clamp (e.g. ILSCO or Blackburn rebar clamp). For rods, acorn clamps (e.g. Blackburn #GC).
Exothermic Weld Kits: In critical applications (data centers, hospitals), exothermic bonding may be required for grounding (to minimize resistance). Cadweld by Erico is the go-to. These are one-time-use welding shots that molecularly bond copper to copper or copper to steel (often used to bond wire to ground rod or rebar instead of clamps).
Bonding Jumpers: If your duct bank includes any metallic conduit sections or if there are segmented grounds, you’ll need bonding jumpers. For example, bonding bushings with jumper wires on each end of a metal conduit run if required, or bonding around a plastic water meter. Keep some lugs and listed bonding jumpers ready.
Consumables & Miscellaneous: Don’t overlook the small stuff:
Warning Tape: As mentioned, usually a 3″ wide plastic tape that says “CAUTION BURIED ELECTRIC LINE” (often color-coded red for power). 3M makes underground warning tapes that are detectable (with metallic tracer) – helpful if future crews need to locate with a metal detector.
Spray Paint & Flags: For marking layout (use APWA standard colors – red for electric, yellow gas, etc.). Not a fancy material, but essential for site prep. Stock marking paint in your gang box.
PVC Solvent Cement & Primer: Must be UL-listed for electrical conduit (often purple primer to satisfy inspectors it was used). Common brand: Oatey PVC primer (purple) and medium-body cement (gray for electrical conduit).
Fasteners & Anchors: For any strut or supports in vaults or to secure conduits on walls, use quality anchors. Hilti epoxy anchors (HIT series) or wedge anchors are often used to mount equipment like transformer pads or panel boards to concrete – though this might come later, you might set anchor bolts now for pads. Hilti is a trusted brand for anchoring solutions in commercial jobs.
Sealants: Duct seal or silicone for sealing conduit openings (to stop water or gas migration). 3M Duct Seal (a putty) is often used at meter cabinets or service entries. Also, Scotchcote (by 3M) is a field-applied coating you can brush on buried threaded connections or damage to galvanizing to prevent corrosion – a handy product in the Chicago area due to soil moisture.
Prefabrication Aids: If prefabbing duct banks, materials like rebar cages or custom wood templates might be used. For instance, a plywood template with holes drilled at conduit spacing can hold stub-ups perfectly during a concrete pour – these are often custom-made on site (a little carpentry as part of electrical work!).
Tools & Equipment
Having the right tools makes the work efficient and safe. Below is a breakdown of tools commonly used in the site prep and underground rough-in phase:
Excavation Equipment: Large-scale projects rely on heavy machinery. Hydraulic excavators or backhoes are used for trenching long runs. In tight urban sites (like downtown Chicago), sometimes a small excavator or even manual digging is needed. Trencher machines can cut narrow trenches quickly for smaller conduits (though not common for large duct banks). Ensure excavation equipment is operated by qualified personnel and that a spotter is present to avoid over-cutting or hitting existing utilities.
Survey & Layout Tools: Precision layout tools are crucial. A laser level or builder’s level helps maintain trench depth and slope. A transit or total station (e.g. Hilti or Trimble Total Station) is used to precisely locate conduit stub-ups and insert sleeves in formwork – often a must for high-rises where the electrical rooms are tightly coordinated. Long measuring tapes (100 ft tape) and chalk lines help mark straight conduit paths. GPS markers and survey stakes may be provided by a surveyor for exact routing.
Conduit Installation Tools: For PVC conduit, the tools are relatively simple: PVC saws or ratcheting pipe cutters for cutting conduit, deburring tools (Ideal or Klein reamers) to smooth edges, and brushes/applicators for primer and cement. Carry a heat gun or heater box if on-site bending of PVC is needed (heat bending PVC is an advanced skill but can form custom sweeps). For rigid metal conduit, more heavy-duty tools are needed: a pipe threader (like Ridgid 300 power threader) with the correct dies for each conduit size, a tri-stand vise to hold conduit while threading, and a hydraulic or mechanical bender. For 1/2″–1″ conduit, a hand bender (aka Chicago bender for EMT, or a hickey bender for RMC) can make small offsets and bends. For 2″ and up, use a hydraulic bender (Greenlee 881 or 555 series for up to 2″, and maybe factory bends for larger). Also have plenty of tape measures, levels, and angle finders to check your conduit bends.
Lifting and Handling: Conduits (especially steel) can be heavy in large sizes (a 10′ stick of 4″ GRC is hefty). Use dollies or pipe carts to move bundles of conduit. For placing large duct bank assemblies or vaults, a crane or boom truck might be needed – coordinate with general contractor if necessary. Even a small gantry or chainfall can help lower heavy preassembled conduit sections into a trench.
Power Tools: A generator or temporary power drop will be needed on site for tools. Key power tools include rotary hammer drills (Hilti TE series or Bosch) for drilling into concrete (maybe to pin conduit or install grounding pigtails to steel). A hammer drill with a ground rod driver bit is extremely useful to drive ground rods instead of using brute force. Sawzall (reciprocating saw) for cutting strut or conduit quickly. Portable band saw for cleaner cuts on conduit or threaded rod. If core drilling is needed (e.g. to penetrate an existing foundation wall for conduit entry), a core drill rig with diamond bits will be used (Hilti core drill systems are common for this).
Safety & PPE: Not to be overlooked – hand and power tools require proper safety gear. Hard hats, steel-toe boots, high-visibility vests (especially when heavy equipment is moving around), and safety glasses are mandatory on site. For trench work, use harnesses and ladders for safe access (as in the image, ladders in trenches are required every 25 feet or so). When cutting or grinding, wear gloves and face shields. Hearing protection when running loud equipment (like threaders or jackhammers) is important as well.
Testing Tools: During underground rough-in, you might use a few testing devices: a multimeter or continuity tester to verify bonding (for instance, check that the rebar tie wire connection to your ground lead is good), and possibly a meggohmmeter (megger) to test that a long run of conduit is clear (by meggering a pull rope or just ensuring insulation isn’t present yet – this is more for later when conductors are in). A duct integrity mandrel (a foam or metal plug pulled through conduits) can be used after concrete encasement to ensure no deformities inside – this is a specialized tool, essentially a proving mandrel that’s just slightly smaller than conduit inner diameter.
Miscellaneous: Sledgehammers (for driving stakes or nudging conduit into alignment), shovels and trench spoons for fine digging and clearing around conduit, buckets to carry sand for bedding, and pumps for water removal. Also, keep a label maker or spray paint handy to mark conduits (some crews mark the ends of conduits with their circuit number or destination using a paint pen – can save confusion later). In Chicago projects, a camera or phone is also a tool – to take pictures of everything before it’s buried, serving as documentation and protection against future disputes.
Trade Coordination
The underground phase involves heavy coordination with multiple trades and entities. A general foreman must communicate effectively to prevent conflicts and ensure smooth progress:
General Contractor / Site Superintendent: They orchestrate site activities. Coordinate the trenching schedule with them – e.g. ensure excavation for electrical conduits is done when the site is open and not filled with other utilities. The GC will also schedule the concrete pours; you must have your conduits and Ufer ground in place before the foundation pour. Attend the site coordination meetings to voice any needs (like sleeving through a footing or reserving space for a duct bank route).
Excavation Crew: Often a civil subcontractor or laborer crew will do the digging. Mark the trench lines clearly for them and explain required depths. Walk the trench line together to check for obstacles (like “We need to avoid this existing sewer line by going deeper here”). Ensure they know if any trench needs special shaping (for example, a wider pit where a manhole will sit, or multiple steps for tiered conduits). Also coordinate trench backfill – sometimes they backfill, or sometimes your electrical crew might backfill around conduits to be safe. Clear communication prevents the “oops, we backfilled before inspection” scenario.
Concrete / Foundation Team: The concrete crew needs to know where your conduits will penetrate or be embedded. Work with them to place sleeves or blockouts in footings and walls. For example, if main feeders go under a footing, coordinate to put sleeve pipes through the footing form before pour. If a duct bank enters a building, you might need to cast a conduit sleeve or galvanized pipe through the foundation wall – coordinate on size and sleeve material (typically 2x the diameter of the conduit bundle, sealed later). When placing conduits in slab, align with the rebar team: they’ll allow you in once the rebar is tied (so you’re not in each other’s way). Also schedule a hold on the pour until an inspector signs off the conduits and grounds in the footing – the concrete lead and foreman must be on the same page so nothing gets buried without inspection.
Plumbing & HVAC Trades: Other trades often have underground work (plumbers for drains, sprinkler mains, etc., and mechanical for chilled water, etc.). Coordinate routing to avoid clashes – for instance, you might have to run your electrical conduits under a sanitary line or vice versa. By code, certain separations must be maintained: keep electrical conduits a safe distance from hot pipes to avoid derating, and from gas lines for safety. Common practice is at least 12” horizontal separation from gas or water lines, and if crossing, do so at 90 degrees with some vertical spacing. Coordinate with plumbing on trench sharing – sometimes a single trench can accommodate multiple systems if carefully planned (with electrical at a certain depth and water above, for instance), but make sure to get it in writing and approved by inspectors. For high-rises, much of the plumbing is in the slab too – make sure your floor conduits aren’t where floor drains or piping need to go. Weekly coordination meetings with all MEP trades are invaluable during underground rough-in.
Utility Company (Power and Telecom): In Chicago, ComEd (the utility) may be involved if you’re installing the service conduits from the property line to the building. Coordinate with ComEd for requirements: they often specify the number and size of conduits, material (often they require RMC or Schedule 40 PVC with concrete encasement in streets), and the radius of bends (e.g. use long sweeps, typically 36″ radius for primary duct). They may require an inspection of these service conduits before you backfill. Similarly, coordinate with telecom providers: large projects might have you install 4″ conduits from the street to the phone/data room. These may need to be separated from power (try to maintain at least 12″ separation to avoid interference). The telecom conduits might be scheduled at the same time as electrical to avoid multiple trench works – so loop in the telecom contractor or AT&T if needed.
Inspectors and Authorities: Electrical inspectors (and sometimes a separate utility inspector) are key stakeholders. Schedule inspections ahead of time to avoid delays. The City of Chicago might send a city electrical inspector, and if it’s a healthcare facility, possibly a state inspector or consultant for OSHPD (in some states) or for Joint Commission review – ensure all know when the site is ready. Also, if the project has special inspection requirements (like a structural observer verifying the Ufer ground rebar connection), coordinate that. Basically, treat inspectors as part of your team – communicate openly, ask questions if unclear on something (better to clarify upfront than to fail an inspection).
Other Electrical Teams: On massive projects, there may be multiple electrical crews (e.g., one handling site distribution, another doing interior). Coordinate with any in-house or subcontracted low-voltage contractors as well – if security or fire alarm needs spare conduits underground, it’s far easier to put them in now than later. An example: the fire alarm contractor might want a 2″ PVC stub between buildings for future expansion – if you know that early, you can include it in your rough-in and avoid a change order later. Regular coordination with all teams ensures the underground phase covers everything needed.
Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
Even experienced electricians encounter challenges in underground work. Here are common pitfalls for this phase – and ways to avoid them:
Insufficient Depth or Cover: One of the most frequent fails is conduit that’s not buried deep enough. For instance, PVC put in at 12″ when 18″ is required will fail inspection​
ECMWEB.COM
. Avoid this by double-checking code minimum depths and using marked grade stakes in the trench to gauge depth. When in doubt, err on the side of a little too deep (as long as you coordinate with other utilities).
Conduits Misaligned at Stub-Ups: It’s easy to have stub-ups shift during backfill or pour, resulting in misalignment (they don’t line up with equipment or walls). This can cause panic when it’s time to connect to gear. Prevent it by using sturdy templates or spacers at stub-ups, and secure them (tie to rebar or formwork). Before concrete sets or backfill is completed, re-check measurements and plumb. A classic trick: use a piece of Unistrut and u-bolts to hold a cluster of conduits in the right configuration at the stub-up group.
Forgetting the Grounding Stub or Bonding: Sometimes crews forget to attach the Ufer ground conductor to the rebar before the pour, or forget to install the ground rod. Once concrete is poured, you’ve lost the easy access. Always include grounding in your pre-pour checklist. It helps to literally tag the rebar with a note “Ground here” or have the wire pre-tied so it’s visibly sticking out as a reminder.
Improper PVC Glue Joints: Rushing the solvent welding can lead to joints that pull apart underground (especially if conduit moves or if backfill occurs too soon). A failed glue joint buried under concrete is a nightmare (it could create a path for concrete to fill the conduit). Follow the PVC cement instructions – in cold weather, give extra set time; in hot weather, don’t let the solvent evaporate too fast. Always use primer (inspectors look for that purple stain as proof). Tug each joint after a minute to ensure it’s locked. And don’t forget to glue both sides (it has happened that one side was primed and glued, the other side dry – which can lead to a weak bond).
Debris or Water in Conduits: During construction, open conduits can get filled with dirt, rocks, or water. Later, this makes pulling wire extremely difficult and can damage cables. Water infiltration is particularly common in underground conduits​
ENGINEERCALCS.COM
 – conduits act like french drains. Always cap or tape the ends of conduits when work stops. If you see water pooling, try to drain it or keep conduits elevated above trench water. Before pulling wire, flush or vacuum out conduits if needed. Use duct seal to plug open ends if rain is expected.
Damaged Conduits (Cracks/Breaks): A conduit can crack if a large rock hits it during backfill or if it’s bent beyond its limits. A common oversight is not noticing a small crack in PVC, which later lets roots or water in. Inspect the conduits visually along their length before covering. If heavy equipment is driving near shallower conduits, you may need to provide steel plating or extra cover during construction to prevent collapse. For RMC, watch out for threaded joints not fully tight – a partially engaged thread can later lead to conduit separations under stress.
Missing Supports or Restraint: Underground conduit doesn’t need strapping like aboveground, but during installation, lack of support can cause sagging or floating. If a long run of PVC isn’t adequately weighted or staked, when concrete is poured it might “float up” from its intended position. Use rebar ties, stakes, or weights (some crews lay a sack of concrete or sand on long runs temporarily) to keep conduits down until covered. In duct banks, secure the assembly thoroughly.
Mix-ups in Identification: With many conduits in parallel, it’s easy to lose track of which is which when they stub up in a vault or room. This can cause confusion when pulling cables (you might send a feeder down the wrong conduit). Avoid this by marking conduits: use a permanent marker or label tape inside the end cap with an identifier (“Feeder 1 of 4 to Panel X”) or use colored tape wraps (e.g., wrap one conduit with one stripe of tape, the next with two stripes, etc., and note it on drawings). Document any spare or empty conduits clearly for future use.
Not Accounting for Future/Extras: A pitfall is doing only what’s on the plan and not considering future needs or changes. Later, someone might realize a spare conduit for future expansion would have been wise, but now the slab is poured. If the specs call for spares or if the owner hinted at future plans, install those extra conduits now (it’s cheap insurance). Similarly, if a design seems to lack something obvious (like no conduit for fire pump feeder?), raise the RFI now rather than assuming it can be surface-run later.
Scheduling Delays: Underground work can cause project delays if not finished on time (because other trades can’t proceed until backfill and slab are done). A pitfall for a new foreman is underestimating the time required. Avoid this by planning sufficient manpower and possibly prefabrication. Also, be ready for inspection – if you miss the inspection slot and have to wait days, it holds up the pour. Schedule early and have everything 100% ready.
By staying vigilant and using these preventative measures, you can steer clear of most common underground rough-in problems. Remember, once it’s buried, problems only get more expensive!
Advanced Techniques and Best Practices
Top general foremen and crews use advanced methods to improve quality and speed. Here are some field-tested advanced techniques for site prep and underground rough-in:
Prefabrication of Duct Banks: To save time on site, consider pre-building sections of duct bank. For example, you can assemble 4×4 banks of 4″ PVC conduit in 20 ft sections on the surface (complete with spacers and tied rebar), then lift and place them into the trench as a unit. This ensures consistent spacing and significantly cuts down installation time on large runs​
ECMWEB.COM
. Some contractors build custom jigs to hold conduits in the correct configuration during assembly. Prefab can shift work to a controlled environment and reduce the on-site crew size needed at a given time. (Just ensure precise measurements so your prefabbed sections fit between fixed points!)
Total Station Layout: Embrace tech for layout. Robotic total stations (like the Hilti PLT300 or Trimble RTS) can take BIM coordinates and lay out insertion points on the field with millimeter accuracy. On a big hospital job, for instance, you might have dozens of floor box stubs that need to align with future walls or equipment. The total station will shoot these points on the subgrade or formwork, saving hours of measuring and dramatically reducing human error. This is an advanced practice that pays off in complex builds or where conduit congestion is high.
3D BIM Coordination: In the planning stage (which affects site prep), use 3D modeling to coordinate underground pathways. By modeling duct banks, plumbing, sewer, etc. together, you can find clashes virtually and adjust before digging. In high-rises, a small change like shifting a conduit run 6″ can avoid cutting rebar. Many Chicago contractors now use BIM coordination meetings – bring your knowledge of code-required spacing to those meetings. Advanced foremen will input suggestions (like adding spare conduits, or grouping certain services) in the BIM plan that make installation easier.
Hydro-Vac Excavation for Sensitive Areas: When working near existing utilities or in congested urban areas (think Chicago Loop with all the old infrastructure), hydro-vacuum excavation is an advanced digging method. Instead of a backhoe blindly digging, a hydro-vac truck uses high-pressure water and suction to safely expose existing lines. This can be used to dig potholes to locate existing utilities or even to trench small runs with minimal risk. It’s slower than mechanical digging but extremely useful to avoid utility strikes and to dig precisely around critical structures.
Dewatering and Soil Stabilization: On sites with high water table or running sand, keeping a trench dry is an art. Advanced setups use well points or eductor systems around the excavation to continuously pump water out (lowering the water table temporarily). If the soil is very loose, sometimes a dilute cement slurry or bentonite is used to stabilize trench walls long enough to work. Knowing these techniques can be a lifesaver if you find your trench collapsing or flooding. It might involve coordination with a dewatering subcontractor, but understanding the principle (keep water 2 feet below your trench bottom)​
ENGINEERCALCS.COM
 helps you plan.
Use of Specialty Conduits: While standard PVC and RMC cover most needs, specialized conduit can be advantageous in certain scenarios. HDPE conduit (high-density polyethylene) comes in long coils and can be directional-bored with no trench. For critical runs across roads or finished surfaces, consider directional drilling to avoid open cuts. HDPE isn’t usually used within building property for feeders in Chicago (since it’s hard to terminate to metal boxes), but for telecom or special cases it’s an advanced option. Also, fabric innerduct systems (multiple conduits in a single fabric sleeve) can be pulled into a larger conduit – an advanced method to add pathways without multiple parallel installs.
Cathodic Protection for Metal Conduits: In installations like fueling facilities or where steel conduits are extensively underground and corrosion is a concern, cathodic protection (sacrificial anodes or impressed current systems) can be installed. While not common for standard commercial buildings, if you have long runs of metal conduit in harsh soil, an advanced foreman might propose wrapping conduits with protective coating or even adding a zinc anode to prevent corrosion (especially if code or spec requires a 30-year life on that install).
Laser Scanning for As-Builts: After installing conduits, some projects now use laser scanners to capture the exact location of underground work before it’s covered. This creates a 3D point cloud record. It’s an advanced practice that can be super helpful later in the project or for maintenance years down the line. If the owner is tech-forward (like a data center client), they might appreciate this extra step. It also protects you – you have evidence of where everything was if any issue arises.
Precision Grounding (Testing and Enhancement): Advanced teams will test the grounding electrode system resistance before the electrical service is landed. Using a ground resistance tester (fall-of-potential test), you can verify the ground rod/Ufer system meets the <25 ohm criterion (NEC 250.53 A.2). If not, you have time to add rods or a ground ring now. Doing this early is proactive and shows a high level of professionalism, especially important for sensitive facilities (hospitals, data centers) where ground quality matters for equipment.
Resource Optimization (Labor Multipliers): A savvy general foreman uses advanced planning to optimize crew effort. For example, allocate apprentices to do time-consuming tasks like laying out hundreds of 1/2″ embeds for lighting floor boxes, while your journeymen focus on bending the large conduit. Use NECA labor units (discussed below) to predict which tasks are labor intensive, and consider splitting crews or working in parallel. On a fast-track job, you might run two shifts for underground: day crew prefabs and sets conduit, night crew does the pour or backfill – advanced scheduling that compresses timelines (though watch out for fatigue and safety with such approaches).
Quality Assurance Tech: Some advanced tools for QA/QC include using a borescope camera to inspect the inside of conduits (to ensure no obstructions) before cable pulling, and RFID tagging underground components (RFID tags on pull boxes or ground rods that can be scanned later to identify them under asphalt). These are cutting-edge practices that aren’t mainstream yet but show the direction the industry is heading – integrating technology for smarter installations.
Implementing these advanced techniques can set you apart, enabling faster completion, higher quality, and a more organized jobsite. They require planning and sometimes investment in technology, but on large-scale projects, they often pay for themselves in avoided rework and efficiency gains.
IBEW Trade Secrets and Pro Tips
Every seasoned Chicago union electrician has a toolkit of “tricks of the trade” passed down from mentors. Here are some IBEW-flavored trade secrets to excel in underground work:
“Measure Twice, Dig Once”: An old adage but critical underground. Experienced foremen will double-check all layout dimensions against not just the electrical drawings, but also structural plans. A trade secret is to always verify stub-up locations relative to building column lines or gridlines. For example, in Chicago high-rises, an IBEW foreman might say: “Pull from the column – that column isn’t moving, so measure off it for your conduit embeds.” Using the building’s structural references ensures your electrical embeds align perfectly with architectural features (like walls or equipment pads), avoiding costly chiseling later.
Use of Chicago Bends: The “Chicago bend” isn’t named after the city by accident. Local electricians perfected the art of bending conduit with a hand bender to create a slight kick or offset precisely where needed. A tip: when you stub up conduits in a line, intentionally leave them leaning a few degrees outward. After the concrete pour, you can nudge them to plumb – if you set them exactly plumb pre-pour, the swelling concrete sometimes pushes them inward. By anticipating that, you end up with perfectly straight conduits after the pour. It’s a subtle trick learned on job sites over years.
Hilti Gun for Ground Rods: Driving an 8′ ground rod by hand in Chicago clay can be back-breaking. A favorite trick is using a Hilti powder-actuated tool (typically used for shooting pins) with a special rod-driving head, or more commonly, using a demolition hammer (90 lb hammer) with a ground rod bit. The trick is to let the tool do the work – the weight and vibration sink the rod in straight. Old timers say to pour a little water in the rod hole or on the rod as it drives; whether myth or not, they swear it goes in easier. Another hack: if a rod strikes an obstacle at 6′ down and won’t go further, drive a second rod a few feet away and bond them – it’s allowed to have multiple rods if one can’t get deep enough.
Stepping Conduits for Easier Wire Pulls: When installing multiple conduits that will turn up into a switchgear, the pros will stagger the lengths of the conduits before making the vertical 90s. The result is the bends are not all in the same plane – they step like an organ pipe. This avoids all the cables having to make the turn at the exact same point, reducing jam. It’s not in the print, but an IBEW crew might decide to cut each conduit a bit shorter than the next before the sweep so that the sweep transitions are graduated. It makes pulling large feeders smoother (less friction), a trick you learn after struggling with a set of wires in parallel conduits that all bent at one point.
Soap the PVC Joints: In cold weather, PVC glue can set slowly. There’s a trick to wipe a bit of dish soap on the PVC pipe end (not on the mating surfaces, but right up to the shoulder). If you accidentally get excess cement, the soap prevents it from welding the pipe to the dirt or adjacent conduit when you’re sliding it in. Also, some swear a soaped joint will slide together easier allowing full insertion before the cement grabs. Just don’t get soap inside the joint surfaces (can interfere with the bond).
Rebar as a Locator: When you have a long run of PVC under a future slab and worry about finding it later, here’s a trick: lay a piece of rebar or metal wire alongside the conduit run (just above it) before backfill. This effectively acts as a tracer – later, a metal detector can pick up the rebar so you know where the conduit is. Some will do this if they expect future trades might need to find the conduits (since PVC itself is non-metallic). This is unofficial and not in specs, but an old-school hack (just ensure it doesn’t interfere with anything or cause a bonding issue – ideally it’s tied into the grounding system to be safe).
Keep a “Dummy” Conduit for Fish Tape: When installing a bank of conduits, the IBEW veteran might run an extra empty 1″ conduit snaked along the same route temporarily – using it as a path to pull a mouse or fish tape through the main conduits later if needed. Essentially it’s a sacrificial conduit to help get pull lines in if your pre-installed pull strings break or get lost during the pour. After use, that dummy can be abandoned or used as a spare. This isn’t always feasible, but on long runs it can save the day if something goes wrong with the pull line in the actual conduits.
Apprentice Utilization: A trade secret from the union world – train your apprentices by letting them shadow these tasks early. For example, have a 3rd-year apprentice plan and execute a small underground branch run (under supervision). They learn layout and you get an extra set of eyes. Many foremen attribute their efficiency to having well-trained juniors who can anticipate needs (having the next stick of conduit ready, knowing how to mix grout for a ductbank end, etc.). IBEW culture emphasizes mentoring; an apprentice who’s been taught the underground rough-in ropes becomes immensely valuable in later phases.
Local Supplier Relationships: In Chicago, material logistics can make or break a schedule. Savvy foremen have strong relationships with suppliers like Graybar or Steiner Electric. A “secret” is that you can pre-set delivery of conduit in bundles staged around the site (especially for high-rises, where you might get a flatbed to drop off conduit on each floor as the structure goes up). For underground, ensure large conduits, spacers, rebar, etc., are delivered near the excavation point to minimize double-handling. A good supplier rep will also rush out that one box of couplings you forgot. Leverage those relationships – sometimes they’ll loan you specialty tools (pipe heaters, etc.) as a courtesy.
Coffee and Donuts with Inspectors: Not exactly a technical trick, but a cultural one – treat your inspector with respect (and maybe a warm beverage on a cold day). Chicago inspectors are tough but fair. Building a rapport can smooth the process; they might give you tips or heads-ups (e.g., “Make sure you bond that bushing, I’ll check that tomorrow”). It’s a soft skill that experienced foremen use to ensure inspections go without a hitch. Always be ready and honest – if something’s not done, say so rather than trying to hide it. Integrity goes a long way on union jobsites.
These trade secrets encapsulate the on-site wisdom that isn’t in textbooks. Applying them will help a motivated apprentice or new foreman work smarter, uphold the high standards of the IBEW workforce, and gain the respect of the crew.
Quality Control (QC) Checklist
Use this checklist to ensure all critical items for site prep & underground rough-in are completed and verified. A good practice is to review this QC list before calling for inspection or pouring concrete:
✅ Conduit Type & Size: All conduits installed are correct type (material) and trade size per plan. (E.g. feeders in 4″ PVC, branch in 1″, etc., with metallic where required.) No unauthorized substitutions.
✅ Burial Depth: Conduit depths meet NEC/Chicago code – measured cover is at or greater than required (18″ min for PVC, 6″ for RMC in earth, etc.)​
ECMWEB.COM
. Check a few random spots with a tape before backfilling.
✅ Spacing and Configuration: Parallel conduits are evenly spaced and properly racked (especially in duct banks). Conduits are not touching each other (unless bundled by design) and there’s room for concrete encasement if required.
✅ Joint Integrity: PVC glue joints – visually check for full solvent spread (purple primer visible, no gaps). Try to lightly tug or twist – they should not move. For threaded conduits, ensure at least 5 threads engaged and couplings tightened. All couplings on rigid conduit are wrench-tight with no visible threads showing past the coupling.
✅ Bends and Radius: All bends are smooth and meet minimum radius requirements (no kinked EMT or too-tight PVC sweeps). If any field bends in RMC/IMC, they are made with proper tools and not over-bent (flattening). No segment bends (factory elbows used for 90s in large conduit rather than multiple tiny bends).
✅ Protection & Caps: Conduit ends (stub-ups) are capped or otherwise blocked to prevent ingress of concrete or dirt. Throughout the install, open ends remained covered (reducing debris inside). Caps will stay on until pull time.
✅ Grounding Installed: Ufer ground installed (if applicable) – #4 bare copper properly attached to rebar (inspect that connection before pour). Ground rods installed at specified locations and depths. All grounding electrode connectors tight (exothermically welded or wrenched tight on clamps). Bonding jumpers in place for any metal raceways that might be isolated by plastic segments.
✅ Bonding of Rebar (if required): If the spec calls for bonding building steel or rebar, those connections are made (typically via rebar connection to Ufer, which suffices). Ensure no loose ends – for example, if a ground wire was left for structural steel, it’s long enough and accessible.
✅ Separation from Other Utilities: Verify clearances from other services – no conduit resting directly on a hot water pipe or mixed in with a gas line, etc. If parallel in same trench, a divider or spacing is provided. Document any close crossings with photos in case of questions later.
✅ Pull Boxes/Handholes: Any underground boxes or handholes are installed level, at correct grade, and oriented properly. Lids are secured and marked (e.g. “Electric”). Drainage (if required) is addressed (drilled drain holes or gravel sump beneath handholes if per spec). Sweep entries are properly terminated in boxes with bushings and bonds.
✅ Slope (if applicable): If certain conduits require slope (for example, empty conduits for future data cabling might be laid with slight slope to manholes to drain water), verify it. Typically most power conduits don’t require slope, but ensure no unintended low spots that could trap water if avoidable.
✅ Concrete Encasement (if required): For duct banks needing encasement, forms or barriers are ready, rebar (if specified around duct bank) is placed, and mix design for concrete is per spec (often 2500 psi red dyed). All conduits tied down to prevent float. Have test cube samples taken if required by QC plan.
✅ Rebar Clearance: For conduits in slab or footing, ensure they do not displace required rebar. All conduits have minimum 2″ concrete cover from any exterior surface of concrete (check top clearance in slab – e.g. conduit isn’t too close to surface).
✅ No Damage: Perform a walkover to inspect for any visible damage: cracked conduit, crushed sections, or displaced pipes. Run a snake or fish tape through critical runs to ensure they are clear (especially after concrete has set, to detect if any collapse occurred).
✅ Labeling/Marking: Conduits are labeled or identifiable per plan (at least at ends). If using colored tape or written identifiers on caps, verify each conduit’s designation matches the as-built markups.
✅ As-Built Drawings Updated: While memory is fresh, mark up drawings with any field changes (location of a conduit run, depth changes, additional bends, etc.). Include any added spare conduits or reroutes. These will be later drafted properly, but the field markup is critical.
✅ Photos & Documentation: Photos taken of trenches with conduits before backfill (if required by contract or just for records). Inspection sign-off sheet is completed and filed. If any tests were done (continuity, ground resistance), results are noted.
✅ Housekeeping: All debris (cut-off conduit pieces, tie wire, etc.) removed from trench. No trash or scrap buried. The site is left safe – trenches backfilled or barricaded if left open, no tripping hazards from stub-ups (mark them with flagging tape).
By systematically checking each item above, you ensure the underground installation is code-compliant, robust, and well-documented. This QC step is what differentiates a top-notch foreman – catching any issues now before they’re literally set in stone (or concrete!).
Labor Unit References (NECA & Estimating Data)
Understanding labor units helps in planning and benchmarking productivity. The NECA Manual of Labor Units (MLU) provides standard labor-hour estimates for common installation tasks under average conditions. Here are some relevant labor unit references for the site prep & underground rough-in phase:
Conduit Installation (per 100 ft): As a baseline, small conduits are faster to install than large ones. For example, installing 100 feet of 3/4″ PVC Schedule 40 conduit is estimated at 4.5 labor-hours​
CHAMPIONFIBERGLASS.COM
 under average conditions. In contrast, larger conduits take significantly more time – 100 feet of 4″ PVC Schedule 40 is ~14 labor-hours, and the same length of 4″ GRC (rigid steel conduit) is about 30 labor-hours​
ECMAG.COM
. These figures (from NECA MLU) reflect the extra work handling, threading, and bending large rigid conduit. PVC is quicker due to glue joints and lighter weight, but still scales with size (e.g. 4″ PVC ~16.8 hours/100ft vs. 4″ fiberglass conduit 8.25 hours, which shows how material choice affects labor)​
ECMAG.COM
.
Conduit Bends/Elbows: Labor units often separate straight runs vs. installing elbows or complex bends. A factory 90° elbow in 3/4″ PVC might add around 0.22 hours (13 minutes) of labor​
CHAMPIONFIBERGLASS.COM
 to install (including the extra work to glue and handle it). A 4″ rigid 90° elbow is much heavier and may take around 3.0 labor-hours to install​
CHAMPIONFIBERGLASS.COM
 (this would include setup with machinery or coordinating a lift for a big pre-fab bend). Field bending a piece of conduit also has a labor unit (e.g., a 2″ RMC 90° field bend might be ~1.0 hour). Essentially, more/bigger bends = more time; plan pull boxes accordingly if labor is an issue.
Trenching and Backfilling: NECA MLU primarily covers electrical installation, not excavation (excavation is often figured by civil estimators or using RSMeans). However, you can estimate productivity: for instance, a crew with a backhoe might trench 100 ft/hour in easy soil for a single conduit, but only 20 ft/hour in a congested, hand-dig situation. Always factor in backfill time too – labor units for installing conduit do not include excavation or backfill by default​
ECMAG.COM
, so those need separate allocation.
Grounding: Driving a ground rod is usually a quick task – experienced crews might take 0.5 hours or less per rod with proper tools (including time to set up and make the connection). NECA doesn’t explicitly list ground rod driving in the conduit section, but as a frame of reference, a single 3/4″ x 10′ ground rod drive and cadweld could be ~0.2–0.3 hours for the drive and 0.2 for the weld, totaling ~0.5 hours each under normal conditions.
Manholes / Handholes: If your project has an underground pull box (handhole), labor units are available for those as well. For example, setting a precast concrete handhole (say 4′x4′x4′ size) with a crane might be estimated at ~4-6 hours of electrician labor (mostly supervision and alignment, since a crane and operator do the heavy lifting). Building a cast-in-place manhole is more intensive (could be dozens of hours, but usually that’s done by concrete crews).
Miscellaneous: Laying warning tape is trivial (maybe 0.1 hr per 100 ft just to roll it out). Placing spacers for duct bank might be ~0.5 hr per 100 ft for a run of multiple conduits (just an incremental add-on while installing conduit). Cadwelding a connection (like bonding a wire to rebar) is perhaps 0.2 hr each shot once set up.
NECA Labor Adjustments: Note that NECA units assume average conditions. Chicago projects might have factors that make work slower: hard digging (add labor), extreme cold/hot weather (add 10-20%), congested urban site (add labor), or conversely use of prefab and machinery (which can reduce actual hours vs. NECA book). Estimators often apply a difficulty factor. For example, labor in a downtown high-rise site (lots of coordination, limited space) might be 115% of NECA standard. Knowing the base units, however, lets you quantify how much work is in front of you and track if your crew is beating or lagging the standard. For instance, if NECA says 30 hrs for 100′ of 4″ GRC and your crew of 3 took 1 day (24 man-hours) for that, you’re ahead – good job. If it took 40, identify the holdups (maybe unforeseen rock requiring slow digging).
Real-World Benchmark: A practical benchmark many foremen use: A crew of two experienced electricians can typically lay 100 feet of PVC conduit (trench ready) in a couple of hours, but add time for each bend or elevation change. Rigid metal takes longer primarily due to threading and heavier handling – a crew might install only ~40-60 feet of 4″ RMC per day when including bends and terminations. Always track your progress against the estimate so you can adjust manpower or methods as needed.
Using these labor units as a reference, you can better plan crew size and duration for each task in the underground phase. They’re also useful when justifying manpower requests or evaluating bids. Remember, they are guides – skilled Chicago crews often beat the averages with teamwork and experience, especially when leveraging the “trade secrets” and advanced techniques discussed above.
