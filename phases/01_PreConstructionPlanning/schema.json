    "4-inch square metal box": "1 per ~50 ft or per device location",
    "One-hole conduit straps": "10–12 per 100ft of conduit (support every 10 ft)",

  "trade_coordination": [
    "General Contractor – schedule, site access, concrete pour dates for embeds",
    "Mechanical (HVAC) – ceiling space and shaft coordination for conduits vs ducts",
    "Plumbing – slab penetrations/sleeves and avoiding pipe conflicts",
    "Fire Protection – clearances for sprinkler mains and fire alarm devices",
    "Low Voltage/IT – sharing pathways, electrical room space for IT racks",
    "Utility Company – service entrance requirements and meter vault coordination"

  "common_pitfalls": [
    "Incomplete drawing review leading to missed scope (solution: page-by-page plan review with RFIs for unclear areas)",
    "Underestimating material lead times (solution: order switchgear, generators early and track procurement)",
    "Poor trade coordination (solution: attend BIM/coordination meetings, use 3D models to catch conflicts early)",
    "Ignoring code requirements (solution: consult NEC/Chicago code for every design choice – e.g. GFCI, clearance, fire rating)",
    "Improper labor estimate (solution: use NECA labor units and adjust for project difficulty factors【23†L156-L164】)"
