  "common_pitfalls": [
    "Inadequate cable support leading to sagging or stress on cables. *Solution:* Adhere to code-specified support intervals (J-hooks every 4-5ft) and use appropriate support hardware for the number and type of cables.",
    "Pulling cables with excessive force or creating sharp bends, causing damage and performance issues. *Solution:* Observe minimum bend radius requirements for each cable type. Use cable lubricant for long or difficult pulls. Employ proper pulling techniques.",
    "Failure to use plenum-rated cable in air-handling spaces, resulting in code violations. *Solution:* Verify ceiling type and always use CMP-rated cables in plenum spaces or run cables in metallic conduit.",
    "Insufficient service loops at termination points, making future modifications or repairs difficult. *Solution:* Leave adequate slack (1-2 feet at devices, 3-5 feet at panels) to allow for termination and future adjustments.",
    "Lack of clear and consistent cable identification, leading to confusion during termination and troubleshooting. *Solution:* Implement a comprehensive labeling scheme and label both ends of every cable immediately after pulling.",
    "Ignoring the spatial requirements of other trades, resulting in conflicts and rework. *Solution:* Review all relevant architectural and MEP drawings. Attend coordination meetings and proactively plan cable routes to avoid conflicts.",
    "Mixing different low-voltage systems in the same conduit or cable pathway without proper separation. *Solution:* Maintain physical separation between different systems (e.g., data, fire alarm, security) to prevent interference and ensure code compliance.",
    "Improper grounding and bonding of cable trays and metallic conduits. *Solution:* Follow NEC and local code requirements for grounding and bonding to ensure safety and prevent electrical issues.",
    "Not protecting cables adequately during construction, leading to damage. *Solution:* Install cables in conduit or use protective measures in areas with high traffic or potential for damage.",
    "Assuming all apprentices have the same level of knowledge. *Solution:* Utilize AI-powered training to provide customized learning paths and ensure all apprentices understand the specific requirements of each system."
