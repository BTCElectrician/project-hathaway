Set up the cable feed end at the transformer side (for example) with jack stands to hold the heavy cable reels. At the receiving end (service gear side), set up the pulling winch/tugger. Typically, one would pull from the building side (to pull towards the building) so that the heavy cable feeding equipment (reel) can stay outside by the transformer where there's more room. Attach a pulling eye or head to the group of conductors for one conduit (for parallel runs, you'll pull one conduit at a time). Use plenty of lubricant (apply as the cable enters the conduit). Coordinate a team: one group feeds the cables into the conduit smoothly, another team manages the puller and monitors tension. Communication via radios or hand signals is essential due to distance. Because of the length and bends, monitor the pulling tension with a dynamometer if available to ensure not exceeding the cable’s rated tension (which for large copper could be on the order of a few thousand pounds). If tension is too high, consider a double-pull strategy (pull to a mid-point then re-pull) but since we have no manhole, this would require a very heavy-duty pull or installing an interim pulling eye in the cable (not ideal). Preferably, design kept this to within pulling limits. Pull each set of phase conductors in its own conduit. Make sure to mark or tag each group of conductors (e.g., tag them as Phase A, B, C of set 1, 2, etc.) as they are pulled to keep them organized for termination. Also, ensure equal lengths for all parallel conductors (they should all have the same run length; cut all cables from the same end so there's no extra slack in one conduit’s run vs another).

Commissioning: Once all tests are satisfactory and the inspector approves, the utility will schedule the transformer energization. Typically, the utility will make the final connection of the service conductors to the transformer’s secondary (often by crimping to their stub cables or landing on lugs). The foreman should be present during this and ensure the service disconnect is open (off) so that when the transformer is energized the building equipment is not immediately hot. After utility energizes and leaves, perform a live test: close the service disconnect, measure line-to-line and line-to-neutral voltages at the main bus to confirm correct voltage and phase rotation.

Check trench bottom is smooth and level, or appropriately sloped for drainage if required. Make sure no large rocks could press on conduits. This inspection is often done by the foreman and possibly by an inspector if required.",
    "Conduit Placement: Ensure conduits are installed with proper spacing. For parallel conduits, a consistent separation (e.g., using spacers every 5-8 feet) should be maintained. Check that conduits are not deflecting or coming out of alignment mid-trench. Also confirm that all joints are fully bottomed out in their couplings (sometimes a conduit can push out if not held while glue sets).",
    "Bends and Sweeps: Examine all 90° sweeps (both PVC and rigid) for proper radius and integrity. Factory bends (long sweep PVC or standard large-radius rigid elbows) should be used – confirm no field heat-bending was done on PVC that could flatten the pipe. The two planned 90° bends plus vertical stub-ups should be the only bends; verify that no additional unintended bends (like snaking or misalignment causing an extra bend) occurred.",
    "Duct Bank Formation: Prior to pouring concrete, do a spacer layout check – are conduits evenly spaced, at correct elevation, and is there clearance for the specified concrete cover (e.g., 3\" edges)? Ensure any required rebar is in place and tied correctly. The foreman should sign off that the layout matches the engineered duct bank drawing. The inspector (if applicable) should inspect this as well before pour. After pouring, check for any conduit float (none should have moved if secured, but visual confirmation along the duct bank length for uniform conduit positioning is needed).",
    "Stub-up Alignment: Measure the stub-up conduits’ positions relative to equipment pads or foundations. Each stub-up should align within tolerance so that the equipment (transformer pad or switchgear) fits without stress on conduits. Use a level to ensure stub-ups are plumb. Check elevation: stub-ups should extend to the correct height (too high, and they might need cutting; too low, couplings might end up below the floor level – avoid that). This is typically checked multiple times: after rough placement, after backfill (in case of movement), and before final connection.",

For example, use an ohmmeter to test between each metal conduit (rigid elbow) and the service neutral bar (for service entrance bonding) – it should read effectively zero (continuous). Similarly, test between the neutral bar and ground electrodes to ensure continuity. Every ground rod connection (if accessible) should be firm – give mechanical tug on clamps to ensure they’re tight. The inspector will specifically look at bonding connections on services; ensure bonding bushings have screws tightened, etc.",
    "Pre-backfill Inspection: Before covering, have an inspector verify the installation (in many jurisdictions, an inspection of the conduits in the open trench is required). Quality control from our side: ensure a mandrel or pull string moves freely through each conduit, indicating no blockages. Take photos of the installation for records, showing depth (with a measuring stick) and layout, in case of future questions or if as-built drawings need verification.",
    "Backfill Process: During backfill, ensure that first layers of fill are correctly placed (e.g., initial sand bed and shading over conduits). Have one crew member spot for any conduit movement or damage as the first loads of backfill go in. If using mechanical equipment to backfill, operate at a safe speed to not dislodge conduits. Periodically check that warning tape is placed at proper depth (roughly 12-18\" below grade). If compaction tests are required (e.g., by city for road sub-base), coordinate with testing agency and do not fully pave until compaction is approved.",
    "Cable Pulling Setup Check: Before pulling cable, inspect the conduit end points. Ensure that the insides of conduits are smooth (install bushings or bell ends on PVC where cables will enter or exit to avoid sharp edges). Do a pull rope test: attach a load to the pull rope and simulate a pull to ensure rope moves freely and doesn’t snag. Check that the cable lubricant is on hand and the pulling equipment is calibrated and anchored securely (a failed anchor can be dangerous). All these are QC steps to avoid a mishap during the critical pulling operation.",
    "Cable Testing: After installation, perform an insulation resistance test (megger) for quality assurance. For example, megger each phase conductor to ground at 1000V or 2500V DC (for a 600V rated cable) and look for high resistance (several GΩ is ideal). Record these readings as baseline for future maintenance. If any reading is unexpectedly low, investigate for damage (could be moisture or nicked insulation). Additionally, check phase rotation if relevant (if connecting to existing systems, use a phase rotation meter).",
    "Documentation and Final Walkdown: As a final QC, the foreman or project manager should walk the entire route and inspect for any missing items or issues: All conduit labels in place (if labeling is required by spec for identification at entries), all trash/debris removed from site, all temporary tags or covers replaced with permanent ones (like replace any temporary tape labels on cables with engraved tags if needed). Compare the installation to the drawings and verify everything was installed as designed. Note any deviations in as-built documentation.

Dig up that section and replace the broken conduit piece with a new section (using couplings). If the conduit was slightly flattened but not broken, a mandrel test will catch the reduced inner diameter – you cannot leave it as is if it binds the mandrel. So always run a mandrel or even just the pull rope with a rag to feel for tight spots. If a section feels tight, expose and replace it. It's much cheaper to fix before wires are in.

In design, sometimes conduits are installed with slight pitch to manholes for drainage – in our case with direct run, not much can be done now except draining. If this is a recurring issue, consider installing duct seals after the cables are in (to prevent water traveling through conduits into equipment). Plan cable pulls for dry weather if possible.

If tension gets too high (monitor by dynamometer or by the puller’s load indicator), stop and reassess. You might try a different strategy: pull from the opposite end (sometimes reversing direction helps if one end had a tougher bend). If a cable is stuck, you might carefully apply tension in reverse to pull it back out a bit, then add more lube and try again. In worst-case scenarios, if a cable is completely bound, you might have to abandon that cable and conduit (if it won’t budge at all) and install a new parallel conduit run (very undesirable and expensive). More practically, one could dig up at an accessible point (if any) to cut open the conduit and free the cable (not easy if it's all buried). To avoid this pitfall: ensure the 360° bend rule is followed, use long sweeps, and keep conduits clean. Also, consider intermediate handholes for extremely long runs, but our run was borderline manageable.

      "description": "A common oversight is failing to bond one of the service conduits or leaving out a ground connection, which might be discovered during inspection or later testing. For instance, a bonding bushing screw might not be tightened, or a ground rod never actually connected.",
      "resolution": "To troubleshoot, perform a thorough inspection of all grounding points. If an inspector flags it, address it immediately: install the missing bond jumper or tighten the connection. If discovered after energization (hopefully not, but suppose a conduit was floating electrically), one might notice via infrared (unbonded conduit could heat under fault or show voltage). The remedy is to shut down (if required) and install the missing bond. Always use a checklist for grounding: for each conduit, did we bond it? Each ground rod, did we connect it? It's helpful to have one person responsible for final ground checks (often the foreman). The foreman should also ensure that the neutral bonding jumper is installed at the service disconnect and removed in any downstream equipment (common mistake to bond neutral in two places, causing parallel neutral-ground paths). So quality control on grounding prevents this pitfall."

      "issue": "Failed Inspection Due to Code Violation",
      "description": "An inspector may find something that doesn’t meet code: e.g., insufficient burial depth at some point, conduits not properly strapped or supported, missing expansion fitting, or use of an incorrect material.",
      "resolution": "Address specific violation: If a section is too shallow, you might have to provide additional protection (like concrete over it) or re-trench deeper if possible. If an expansion fitting was missed for a long run, one might cut the conduit and retrofit one (there are clamping expansion couplings that can be installed if space allows). For missing supports, add them (though underground conduits generally are fine once backfilled; above ground, ensure proper supports on vertical risers). The key is to walk the inspector through the job beforehand if possible – foremen often do a pre-inspection check against code. Use the NEC and local code as a checklist during the job. If something is flagged, cooperate with the inspector: they might allow a variance or suggest an easy fix. Always document the correction and get re-inspected promptly to avoid project delays."

      "issue": "Coordination Gaps Causing Rework",
      "description": "Perhaps another trade unexpectedly dug where our conduits were, or poured concrete that blocked our stub-up, etc. Lack of coordination can cause scenarios like a plumbing line ending up directly on top of our conduits, or a paving crew tearing out our warning tape because they milled too deep.",
      "resolution": "The foreman should proactively coordinate (as outlined above). If despite that a conflict occurs, quickly assess on-site: e.g., if a plumbing line conflict, perhaps we can adjust one or both runs slightly (if our conduits are not yet encased, maybe move them over a bit with approval). Or if already encased, see if the plumber can adjust their route (this might involve GC/engineer decision). For paving, ensure they knew about our shallow elements; if tape got removed, re-install tape if trench still open or ensure records of location. Ultimately, solving these conflicts requires good communication. If a mistake happens, own it and fix it: better to do a slight reroute (even if it means an extra bend and a manhole) than to have a serious utility conflict later. Always update drawings so everyone knows the final as-built locations to prevent future trade conflicts."

      "issue": "Schedule Overruns and Crew Management Issues",
      "description": "Delays can happen if, for example, concrete for duct bank was late, or inspection failed, pushing the schedule. Or if crew size was underestimated for the pull and it had to be redone. This can cause budget overruns and stress.",
      "resolution": "A good foreman anticipates these. Build in some float in the schedule for inspections and unexpected delays (weather, etc.). If an inspection fails, prioritize that fix and reschedule inspection ASAP – do not move forward (like don’t backfill before passing inspection; that would cause even worse rework). Manage crew hours: extremely long days to catch up can lead to fatigue and mistakes, so consider adding a second shift or more crew if absolutely required to meet a deadline rather than overworking the same people. For training context: emphasize planning, communication, and knowing when to ask for additional resources. Sometimes spending a bit more on overtime or extra hands is worth avoiding liquidated damages or a disgruntled client. Always keep safety as a non-negotiable even when rushing – an accident would cause far more delay. In summary, plan carefully, monitor progress daily vs goals, and adapt the plan as needed (with approval from project managers) to finish the job right and on time."
