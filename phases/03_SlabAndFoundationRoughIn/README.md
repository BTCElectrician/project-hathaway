# Phase 03: Slab and Foundation Rough-In

## Overview

This phase covers the electrical rough-in work for slab and foundation installations, including conduit placement, grounding systems, and necessary penetrations.

## Key Activities

1. Conduit installation in slab
2. Grounding system implementation
3. Penetration coordination
4. Underground to above-ground transitions
5. Temporary power provisions

## Requirements

### Materials
- Schedule 40 PVC conduit
- Grounding conductors
- Concrete encasement
- Expansion fittings
- Penetration seals

### Tools
- Conduit benders
- Core drills
- Ground resistance testers
- Layout tools
- Safety equipment

## Safety Considerations

1. Trench safety
2. Confined space entry
3. Heavy equipment operation
4. Fall protection
5. Electrical safety

## Quality Control

### Inspection Points
