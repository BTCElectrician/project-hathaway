Electrical Rough-In Training Schema: Slab & Foundation Phase (Chicago Commercial – 8,000 A Service)
Phase Information
Phase Name: Slab & Foundation Rough-In. This phase encompasses all electrical installation work that must be completed in or under the building’s slab and foundations on a large-scale commercial project (e.g. high-rise or large facility in Chicago) before concrete i​

backfilled. It is a critical early phase tailored to heavy commercial jobs, where the building will have an 8,000 amp electrical service – implying very large conduit runs, extensive grounding, and close coordination with other trades. The slab/foundation rough-in sets the stage for the entire electrical system: mistakes here can be literally set in concrete, so planning and precision are paramount. Key aspects of this phase include installing main service conduits (often multiple parallel conduits for high amperage) under the slab, stub-ups for feeders and branch circuits that will emerge into the building, concrete-encased electrodes (Ufer ground), and any underground raceways or inserts needed for electrical infrastructure. It typically occurs after initial site grading and formwork placement, but before the slab or footing concrete is poured. All work in this phase must comply with the National Electrical Code (NEC) as well as Chicago Electrical Code amendments, which are based on the NEC 2020/2023 with local modifications. Phase Objectives: Ensure all necessary electrical components (conduits, sleeves, grounding) are accurately installed within the slab and foundations without conflict with structural elements or other trades. Achieve code compliance (proper burial depths, spacing, supports, etc.【29†L247-L255】) and pass inspections before the concrete pour or trench backfill. This phase is tailored to Chicago practices, meaning using appropriate materials (generally metallic conduits for int​

ch as concrete encasement of non-metallic conduits where required and robust safety measures on site). It is especially critical in a project with an 8,000 A service to correctly install the service duct bank (multiple large conduits) and grounding system, as these carry the building’s huge electrical load and fault currents.

lab & Foundation Rough-In involves a sequence of well-planned tasks. These tasks should be followed in order, though some can overlap with careful coordination. Each step includes coordination checkpoints with relevant trades (plu​
CODELIBRARY.AMLEGAL.COM
ural, excavation, general contractor, etc.) to preempt conflicts.
Pre-Construction Planning & Coordination: Review all construction drawings (electrical, structural, architectural, plumbing) and specifications for the slab and foundation. Develop a layout plan for conduit runs, stub-up locations, ground electrode connections, and sleeves. Mark up drawings with any potential conflicts (e.g. a conduit that appears to pass through a footing or a plumbing line) and resolve them in coordination meetings. Verify code requirements for this phase – for example, minimum burial depths from NEC Table 300.5【29†L247-L255】, and that a concrete-encased electrode (Ufer ground) is indicated for the foundation per NEC 250.52(A)(3)【3†L67-L75】【3†L75-L82】. Identify all components that must be installed before concrete (conduits, boxes, embeds, bonding points). Coordination: Meet with the general contractor (GC) and site superintendent to integrate the electrical rough-in tasks into the overall schedule. Ensure the excavation crew is aware of trenching needs and depths, and the plumbing and HVAC teams have shared their under-slab pipe layouts. Agree on a sequence – for example, electrical conduits might need to go in after underground plumbing is installed (to avoid conduit being in the way of sloped sewer pipes), but before final grading and rebar. Establish a clear point of contact in each trade for on-site adjustments.
Layout and Marking: Perform a precise layout on site. Using site survey references or building gridlines, mark the locations of all major electrical elements:
Conduit routes under slab: mark centerlines or edges of trenches with spray paint or chalk.
Stub-up locations: mark where conduits must emerge (e.g. at future panel boards, floor boxes, or equipment pads). Use measured offsets from column lines or foundation edges for accuracy (e.g. “4’–6” from Gridline X to center of stub-up”).
Grounding points: identify where the grounding electrode conductor (GEC) will connect to the rebar or building steel – often at a footing near the electrical room.
Sleeves or box-outs: mark any required openings through foundation walls or grade beams for future conduit passes.
Coordination: Have the plumbing foreman review the markings with you to ensure electrical and plumbing routes do not clash (e.g. you may find a planned 4″ conduit run crosses a 6″ drain line – better to adjust now on paper than later in the field). Check with the structural team for any restrictions: for instance, are there areas of very shallow slabs or beams where conduit cannot be placed? Structural drawings or ACI guidelines typically restrict conduit size to not weaken concrete (e.g., conduit diameter should not exceed 1/3 the slab thickness【7†L7-L15】). Mark any such areas as no-conduit zones. If the building has thick mat foundations or grade beams, plan for conduits to either go under them (sleeved) or up a​

ists about underground utilities in the area).
Site Prep & Trenching: Before installing conduits, any required excavation must be done. Excavation crews or laborers will dig trenches for underground conduit runs outside or below the slab as needed. Ensure the trench follows the path you laid out and meets depth requirements:
For direct-burial conduits or duct banks, NEC Table 300.5 requires a minimum cover (top of conduit to grade) of 18″ for non-metallic conduit (PVC) and 6″ for rigid metal conduit in general open-ground areas【29†L247-L255】. (Local utility or engineering specifications may require deeper trenches for the main service duct bank; always follow the stricter requirement).
If conduits are under a future building slab, the NEC allows zero inches of cover if the conduit is encased in concrete or under a concrete slab that provides equivalent protection【29†L247-L255】. In practice, however, conduits under slabs are usually placed on grade then covered by the slab pour itself. Chicago practice typically uses rigid metal conduit for any under-slab runs within the building footprint【49†L5-L8】 for durability and code compliance.
If trenching outside the building (e.g. for service feeders from a utility transformer to the building), maintain required depth and width for the conduit bank. Use trench width sufficient for multiple conduits spaced apart or in tiers as per design.
Safety: Follow OSHA trench safety regulations for any trench deeper than 5 ft – this may require sloping the sides or using a trench box【30†L37-L40】. A “competent person” should inspect trench conditions daily【30†L41-L44】. Workers entering any trench > 4 ft should have proper access (ladder) and no one should enter an unsafely protected trench【30†L7-L15】. Also, ensure excavated soil is piled at least 2 ft away from the trench edge (spoils management). Coordination: Schedule the electrical work to begin as soon as the trench or slab area is ready. Have conduits and materials on site so that trenches aren’t left open longer than necessary (important for safety and to allow backfi​

ed). Communicate with the GC/excavation team when sections are ready for you to work in; likewise, inform them promptly when you’ve completed installing conduits in an area so they can backfill or the concrete crew can proceed. Before any backfill, an inspection (by city or engineer) may be required – coordinate the timing of this inspection with the GC and inspector to avoid delays.
Conduit Installation – Main Runs: Install the main conduits in the trenches and forms as laid out. This includes service conduits, feeder conduits, and any branch circuits that must run under the slab. Steps:
Bed the trench (if required) with a layer of sand or fine soil to protect conduits. Check spec or code: Chicago code requires backfill to be clean earth, placed and tamped in layers【30†L15-L23】, but initial bedding with sand is common best practice for PVC.
Lay out conduits starting from one end (for example, from the utility side or main electrical room) and working towards the other end. For an 8,000 A service, you might have multiple large conduits (4″, 5″ or larger) in parallel – often arranged as a duct bank. Use spacers/stand-offs if the design calls for a specific separation or tiered arrangement (particularly if the conduits will be **concrete-e​

duct bank). Ensure conduits remain at the proper elevation and spacing along the entire run.
Join conduits: For PVC, cut to length as needed (allowing for expansion joints if required by code in long runs) and use P​

ent at each coupling. Make sure to apply primer and glue as per the manufacturer’s instructions – do not skip primer (improperly glued joints are a common failure point in underground PVC【14†L205-L213】【14†L207-L214】). For Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC), cut and thread the pipes as needed (using a power threader on large sizes) and tighten all couplings fully (threadless compression couplings, if used, must be listed concrete-tight when buried in concrete【20†L75-L83】). Use anti-corrosion grease on threads if specified. Chicago Note: Under slab on grade, galvanized RMC is typically used【49†L5-L8】, so be prepared fo​

 threading and the weight of steel conduit. PVC may be used for exterior underground runs or if specifically allowed, but must be at correct depth and encased if required by design.
Bending: Use wide sweeps for any 90° turns up into equipment – factory long-radius elbows are preferred for service conduits to ease wire pulling later. Follow NEC bend radius rules; do not make any bend that reduces the internal diameter or exceeds 360° total between pull points【21†L1-L4】. Typically, limit to one 90° elbow in the slab/foundation portion and plan a pull box if more bends are needed. For PVC, if field bending is needed, use a heat blanket or hot box to gently heat and bend – avoid kinked or sharp bends (which violate code minimum radius). For RMC, use hydraulic benders for sizes above 1¼″ to get smooth, code-compliant bends (consult Chapter 9, Table 2 of NEC for minimum bend radii).
Elevation and Slope: Maintain proper depth. For example, if conduits need 18″ of cover, check wit​

tape and level as you install. If the conduit run is subject to drainage concern​

t banks), you might slope them slightly to manholes or pull boxes to avoid water pooling. Typically, under-slab conduits are run level unless otherwise noted.
Stub-Ups: As you near a stub-up point (where conduit turns vertical to come above slab), ensure the vertical piece is accurately located. It often helps to temporarily set the equipment pad or a template to confirm alignment. Use level and squares to keep stub-ups plumb and at correct spacing. For multiple parallel stub-ups (e.g. a bank of conduits entering a switchgear), use a spacer rack or a prefab stub-up jig to hold them in position relative to each other.
Conduit Supports: Secure conduits to stakes or rebar so they don’t move. Tie PVC conduits to rebar with wire, or use rebar stakes on either side so the conduit can be ti​

wet concrete if not secured). Support spacing should follow code (e.g., PVC typically every 3 ft when straight in trench bottom, RMC every 10 ft, etc.), but in a slab pour scenario, more frequent tie-down (every few feet or at every rebar intersection) is wise.
Coordination: During conduit installation, maintain communication with the site superintendent about timeline – e.g., “We will have all conduits in Section A ready for inspection by Thursday.” If any plum​

ical lines still need to go in the same area, coordinate the sequence (you may have to pause while a large plumbing trap is installed, or ask them to leave an opening for your conduit). Work especially closely with the excavation team if they are on site: they can adjust trench depth on the fly if you find a conflict (like hitting unexpected debris or needing a bit more depth for conduit clearance). Also coordinate with utility provider (ComEd) if the service conduits require their inspection or if they have specs (often, utility companies require conduits in concrete duct banks for service feeders, with specific spacers and concrete mixtures – ensure these requirements are met and get sign-off from the utility representative as needed).

Coordination with the excavation crew and proper support for conduits (note the spacer racks keeping conduits aligned) are critical to maintain design spacing before concrete encasement or backfill.
Grounding Installation – Concrete-Encased Electrode (Ufer) and Grounding Grid: In parallel with conduit installation, install all grounding components that must go into the concrete or earth:
Concrete-Encased Electrode (Ufer Ground): For a new building in Chicago, the foundation reinforcing steel will serve as a concrete-encased grounding electrode as required by NEC 250.50 and 250.52(A)(3). Identify a section of the footing or foundation where the main electrical room is nearby. You need **at least 20 ft of continu​

½″ diameter or larger) to bond as the Ufer【32†L111-L119】. Typically, one of the footing rebars is designated; if multiple rebars are used, they must be tied together to total ≥20 ft. Procedure: Remove any non-conductive form ties or coatings on that rebar section. Attach a bonding conductor (usually a bare copper wire, #4 AWG minimum for a Ufer per code) to the rebar. This is often done with a listed rebar clamp or by exothermic welding (Cadweld). The connection must be accessible or brought out of the concrete in a way that it can be connected to the rest of the grounding system. A common method is to Cadweld a #4 AWG copper lead onto the rebar and have about 6–8 feet of that copper wire stubbed out of the side of the footing (protected by a piece of conduit or forming a small recess) so it can connect to the main grounding electrode conductor later. Coordination: Communicate with the rebar placing crew – let them know which rebar needs a clamp or weld. Often the electrical foreman will go in after rebar is tied to do this connection before concrete pour, or sometimes the rebar subcontractor will install a clamp under your guidance. Ensure the point where the wire exits the concrete will not interfere with foundation forms or post-pour finishes.
Ground Rods or Ground Ring (if required): Check the electrical specs – sometimes in addition to the Ufer, a ground​

​

ound the foundation is required (NEC 250.52(A)(4) ground ring, etc.). If ground rods are needed (say near the main service entrance or building perimeter), drive them now before slabs or paving cover the area. A typical ground rod is 3/4″ x 10′ copper-clad steel, driven flush or below grade. Space multiple rods at least 6 ft apart【3†L33-L41】. After driving, attach a bonding jumper (e.g. #3/0 AWG copper for a large service ground) with an irreversible clamp or Cadweld. If a ground ring is used (buried loop of #2 AWG bare copper around the building perimeter), t​
FORUMS.MIKEHOLT.COM
 ft deep around the footing and lay the bare copper, cadwelding or clamping to ground rods at corners as needed. Note: In many large buildings, the Ufer ground (rebar) combined with building steel and water pipe bonds will suffice, but always follow the design – some engineers belt-and-suspenders with additional electrodes.
Bonding to Structural Steel: In Chicago high-rises or large facilities, the structural steel (building frame) must be bonded to the grounding electrode system as well (NEC 250.104(C)). If there are column base plates or embedded steel columns in the foundation pour, prepare to bond them. Often a piece of rebar connected to the column anchor bolts is tied to the rest of the rebar mat – that effectively bonds the steel frame to the Ufer. Alternatively, you may run a bonding jumper from the column (or anchor bolt) to the rebar. Coordinate with the structural team so that any required lug or plate for grounding is in place: for example, some projects weld a lug onto a steel column at ground level for the grounding conductor. If that’s the case, ensure it’s done prior to fireproofing and is accessible.
Underground Metallic Pipes: If there are other underground metallic systems going in (like a site’s metal water service pipe entering through the footing), plan to bond that too as required by code (NEC 250.104(A) for water piping). It’s easier now to clamp a conductor onto a water pipe before everything is buried. The bonding conductor for water pipe must be sized per 250.66 (likely large – for 8000 A service it could be 3/0 or 4/0 copper depending on system grounding). Coordinate with plumbers to ensure a bonding clamp is attached to the water line (on the street side of the meter typically, but that might be later inside – however, if the water entry is through the foundation, you can at least stub a bond wire through with it).
After installing these, leave visible tags or spray paint indicating these critical connections for the inspector to see. For example, you might flag the rebar with tape labeled “Electrical Ufer Ground” so it’s not overlooked. Inspection Hold-Point: The bonding of the concrete-encased electrode must be inspected before the concrete is poured (NEC 250.50 requires that you use any available electrode, so the inspector will want

did it)【32†L129-L137】. Typically, the city inspector will check the Ufer connection on the structural inspection or a dedicated electrical rough-in inspection for underground. Make sure to schedule this inspection with enough lead time. Have the electrician or foreman on site to explain the grounding system to the inspector if needed.
Installation of Boxes, Inserts, and Sleeves: As part of the rough-in, place any required electrical boxes or sleeves that need to be embedded in the concrete:
Floor Boxes: If the design calls for floor outlets or junction boxes flush with the slab (common in l​
MIKEHOLT.COM
areas or lobbies), install the box on its mounting stems or trim so that its top will sit flush with the finished concrete floor. Use adjustable floor boxes if possible, which allow fine-tuning the height. Secure boxes to the formwork or rebar so they do not move during concrete placement. Conduits feeding these floor boxes should already be in place (bend up into the box). Double-check the location and levelness of each floor box (using a laser level or measuring down from a reference string). A best practice is to pour a small “mud pad” or use concrete brick supports under the box to ensure it stays at correct height. Coordination: Work with the architectural plan for exact locations – often the GC will help locate these in the field with you to ensure they align with room layouts, furniture, etc.
Wall Sleeves: If conduits need to pass through foundation walls or grade beams (for example, conduits going out to exterior site lighting or the utility transformer pad), install sleeves before concrete pour. Sleeves can be short pieces of PVC or steel pipe slightly larger than the conduits that will go through them. They are set in the formwork of the wall so that once the wall is poured and forms removed, you have a clear path to later run conduits. Seal the ends of sleeves (tape or plastic caps) to keep concrete out. Mark their positions on the outside of the forms for reference. For an 8,000 A service, typically 4–6 large conduit sleeves might be needed through the foundation wall to the outside utility area – ensure the spacing and grouping matches the electrical plan.
Conduit Stub-Ups and Stubs-Out: For every conduit that will later connect to equipment above the slab, ensure it is stubbed out to the correct spot:
Stub-ups (vertical): These are conduits that will come up through the slab into walls, cabinets, or equipment. Cut them to extend above the finished floor by a safe margin (e.g. 6″–12″, unless plans say flush). It’s easier to cut a little excess off later than to be too short. Group stub-ups that go to the same panel or area and label them if possible (with a paint marker or tag indicating e.g. “Panel DP feeds”). If stub-ups are in the way of the concrete finishing, coordinate to have them cut to just above slab and capped – but make sure you can find them later! (Pro tip: 
CODELIBRARY.AMLEGAL.COM
 two perpendicular reference points and record the location of each important stub-up on an as-built drawing, in case they get buried in subfloor or toppings.)
Stubs-out (horizontal): These are conduits that exit the edge of a slab or footing to continue later (perhaps to feed another building or outdoor equipment). They should extend past the concrete enough to be accessible (typically several feet beyond the pour) and be capped. Often, stubs-out are encased in the concrete for a short distance. Make sure they have the required cover once outside (e.g., if they immediately go underground outside the foundation, they still need 18″ cover or concrete encasement as per 300.5). Use 45° bends where a conduit transitions from in-slab to underground outside, to reduce stress points.
Concrete Encasement for Duct Banks: For the main service conduits (especially non-metallic), the design may call for them to be encased in concrete (RNC (PVC) conduits often need a concrete envelope for physical protection when carrying very high current). If so, you will create a mini-form or use the trench itself to pour concrete around the conduits. Ensure spacers are in place to maintain separation and proper concrete thickness around each conduit (typically at least 3″ of concrete cover around duct bank conduits). You might embed rebar or wire mesh in this encasement (“red concrete” is often specified for electrical duct banks to differentiate them from other concrete). This encasement is usually poured after the conduits are installed and inspected but before final backfill. Plan the logistics: ready-mix concrete trucks or site-mixed? Where will you pour from? etc. Coordination: with GC and structural if encasement interacts with the foundation (e.g., sometimes the duct bank encasement may tie into a foundation wall).
【48†embed_image】 Conduits stubbed up along a foundation wall for connection to future electrical equipment. Precise layout and secure strapping keep these conduits correctly spaced and plumb prior to the pour, preventing costly misalignments. In practice, each conduit’s location is measured and verified to align with equipment requirements.
Quality Checks and Pre-Pour Inspection Prep: Once all conduits, grounding, and embeds are in place, perform thorough self-inspections prior to calling the official inspector:
Conduit Continuity & Spacing: Walk every run to ensure couplings are tight and conduits have not been dislodged. Verify that parallel conduits in banks are evenly spaced and will not encroach into where concrete cover is too thin. (If any conduit ended up closer than 2″ to the surface of concrete, add protective measures or inform structural engineer – e.g. in a 5″ slab, keep conduits at least 1.5″ below top to have adequate cover and to not conflict with slab saw-cut joints).
Depth Verification: Measure cover depth at random spots for buried conduits – ensure minimum cover (e.g., ≥18″ for PVC) is met【29†L247-L255】. Check any “under slab but not in concrete” runs: they should either be under 4″ of concrete or meet the direct burial depth; under building slabs, code is more lenient (0″ cover allowed if under concrete)【29†L249-L257】, but Chicago practice still often requires those conduits be in RMC for physical protection【49†L5-L8】.
Grounding Connections: Verify that the rebar connection (Ufer) is secure (the clamp tightened or Cadweld executed properly) and that the grounding tail is accessible. Verify ground rods are at correct depth (top ~below grade) and attached. Ensure all these are clearly visible for inspection – do not backfill over a ground rod or bury the Ufer clamp in concrete without sign-off.
Bolt Down and Tagging: Make sure any required identification is in place – for example, some specs require plastic tag markers on conduits for what circuit they are (helpful for complex layouts to avoid confusion later). Also ensure conduit ends are capped or taped to prevent concrete from entering. This includes stub-ups (tape them closed or use plastic caps) and any sleeves. It’s amazing how easily wet concrete or debris can find its way into an open pipe and create a blockage.
Photos and As-Builts: Take photos of the installation in case any issues arise later (especially documenting the layout of conduits before pour – useful for future reference or if something gets covered accidentally). Update your as-built drawings with any changes from plan (perhaps you had to route a conduit differently to avoid an unexpected obstruction – mark it).
Prepare for Inspection: Have one set of drawings on site with the installed condition highlighted. Be ready to explain to the inspector how the installation meets code. Common inspection points: proper burial depth (they may physically measure trench depth), conduit type approval (e.g., “is that Schedule 40 PVC? – Yes, here’s the marking.”), spacing of parallel service conduits (to ensure proper derating if not far enough apart, etc.), correct grounding electrode present, and if required, warning tape above service conductors (NEC 300.5(D)(3) requires a warning ribbon 12″ above buried service lines【23†L85-L93】).
Official Inspection: The electrical inspector (and possibly a structural inspector for the footing) will look at the work now. Typical hold points before pouring concrete or backfilling:
Underground conduit inspection (trench open, conduits in place) – the inspector checks depth and that the correct material is used, and that proper support or encasement is ready. In Chicago, they will also confirm you used RMC where required (under buildi​

ff to proceed. Coordination: Make sure the GC knows you have either passed inspection or if any corrections are needed. Do not pour or backfill until all required inspections are passed.
Concrete Pour and During-Pour Vigilance: Although the concrete placement is typically performed by the concrete crew, the electrical team should be present when the slab or encasement is being poured. Assign one or more electricians to:
Monitor that conduit and box positions remain correct as the pour progresses. If workers are stepping near conduits or the force of concrete moves something, gently alert the pour crew or adjust it back in place (using a hook or tape on a rod to pull a conduit that’s shifting – carefully and only if safe).
Ensure that no conduits are damaged by vibrators (the concrete vibration equipment). Floor boxes should have their lids on or taped over to avoid concrete infiltration; watch that the vibration doesn’t push a box deeper or knock off a cap.
If concrete encasement of duct bank is happening, ensure the concrete flows around and under the conduits (no voids). Sometimes you’ll need to lightly shovel or prod to get concrete fully under the bottom conduits of a duct bank. The goal is a solid monolithic encasement with no air pockets.
After pour, while concrete is still workable, double-check critical stub-up alignments and adjust if needed (it’s much easier to nudge a conduit a half inch now than to chip concrete later!). Also, trowel around conduits or boxes that need a smooth finish (the concrete finisher may not know the exact required clearances around a conduit stub).
Safety: During pour, wear appropriate PPE (rubber boots, gloves, safety glasses). Be mindful of not getting trapped by concrete or bumping into finishing equipment.
Post-Pour Wrap Up: Once the slab or encasements are poured and set, do a follow-up:
Survey of Stub-Ups: Immediately after the pour (and over the next day or two), verify that all expected stub-ups are indeed present and visible. Sometimes formwork or dirt can obscure a conduit stub – find them now before they are lost. If any were missed or buried, act quickly to locate and expose them if possible (before the concrete fully cures – early in the curing, concrete can be chipped out more easily around a lost conduit end). Hopefully, with good planning, this doesn’t happen, but a thorough check is necessary.
Remove any temporary bracing: e.g., wood forms that held boxes, and clean off any debris. For encased duct banks, once the encasement is cured, you can remove temporary spacer ties that protruded.
Backfilling: If not already done, trenches can be backfilled after any required curing time. Use proper backfill techniques per code (layered compaction)【30†L15-L23】 to avoid settlement. Make sure warning tape (metallic detectable tape) is placed about 1 ft above buried service conduits【23†L85-L93】 before final backfill, as required by NEC for service conductors.
Record Updating: Finalize the as-built documentation for this phase. This includes noting exact locations of concealed items (e.g., “20′ Ufer ground wire exit at NW corner of footing 12″ below top of wall”), and any deviations. This info will be crucial for future trades and for troubleshooting (for instance, when the time comes to connect the grounding electrode conductor to that rebar end, you’ll consult these notes to know where it is).
At this point, the slab and foundation rough-in should be complete, allowing other trades to continue with minimal interference. The next electrical phase would be wall rough-in and feeders installation as the structure is built, but the groundwork laid here ensures those later stages go smoothly.
Materials
Selecting the correct materials for slab and foundation rough-in is crucial for code compliance and longevity. Below is a breakdown of common materials, including specifications and any code/standards notes (especially Chicago-specific notes). All materials must be listed for their use and meet NEC and Chicago Electrical Code requirements.
Material	Specification & Use	Code / Standards Notes
Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC) – Galvanized Steel	Heavy-wall steel conduit, hot-dip galvanized. Used for under-slab and underground runs especially within building footprint. All joints are threaded. Provides excellent physical protection and serves as a grounding conductor.	Required by Chicago for any under slab on grade conduit runs inside buildings【49†L5-L8】 (PVC not allowed under building slab without encasement). NEC Article 344 governs RMC; it allows RMC in all locations including wet and concrete-encased – threadless connectors must be concrete-tight for slab embeds【20†L75-L83】. Offers a low-impedance ground path when couplings are wrench-tight (NEC 250.4(A)(5), 300.10). Minimum burial depth 6″ if RMC is used underground in earth (NEC Table 300.5)【29†L247-L255】.
PVC Conduit (Schedule 40/80 PVC) – Rigid Nonmetallic Conduit (RNC)	Non-metallic PVC conduit, typically Schedule 40 for general underground use or Schedule 80 for areas subject to damage. Lightweight and corrosion-proof. Used for underground exterior runs such as duct banks from building to utility, or encased within concrete slabs in some cases. Solvent-cemented joints.	NEC Article 352 for PVC. NEC permits PVC underground (direct burial or encased) and in concrete. Chicago amendment 14E-3-352 explicitly permits PVC conduit for underground installations (direct burial or encased)【5†L179-L187】, but PVC is not permitted in other areas not listed in that section【5†L197-L201】 (meaning Chicago generally forbids PVC above grade or indoors except maybe in special corrosive areas). Under a building slab, Chicago practice is to use RMC, but PVC could be allowed if it’s deep in earth under the slab or encased – always check local AHJ preference. Minimum burial depth 18″ for direct burial PVC per NEC Table 300.5【29†L247-L255】. PVC must be supported to prevent movement during pour and expansion joints used if long runs span temperature change areas (NEC 352.44). All PVC elbows in slab should be long radius and schedule 80 if emerging from ground for better strength.
Electrical Metallic Tubing (EMT) – Steel conduit (thin-wall)	Not usually used for direct burial or encasement (EMT is thin and not threaded). EMT is sometimes used within slab for short runs like floor boxes in a protected interior environment (if allowed by code), but in Chicago, EMT is not recognized for underground or in concrete that’s in contact with earth – code limits EMT to above grade, dry or wet locations but not direct burial.	NEC Article 358 for EMT. Chicago Electrical Code generally requires RMC or Intermediate Metal Conduit for anything in concrete or underground; EMT is not permitted in direct burial and would rust if buried. Only mention: use RMC instead of EMT for slab work in Chicago. (EMT might be used above slab in walls later).
Flexible Conduit (FMC or LFMC)	Flexible metal conduit (Greenfield) or Liquidtight flexible (LFMC) generally should be avoided in slabs. They are not suitable for encasing in concrete (FMC is not liquidtight or corrosive-resistant for concrete, and LFMC is allowed in concrete only if listed for it, typically short sections).	NEC 348 & 350. FMC cannot be in wet locations (thus not in slabs that are on grade), LFMC can be in wet but physical damage risk is high【20†L103-L112】【20†L107-L115】. Not a typical material for this phase except possibly a short whip to an island if absolutely needed and local code allows (Chicago would likely not allow at all in slab). Best practice: use rigid conduit instead.
Conduit Fittings & Supports	– Rigid Conduit Fittings: Use threaded couplings and elbows for RMC. Where RMC is embedded in concrete, use concrete-tight couplings/connectors (usually the standard threaded ones are fine; avoid set-screw types entirely in slab). Plastic bushings on conduit ends to protect wires (NEC 344.46 requires bushings on conduit ≥ 4 AWG)【20†L87-L94】.
– PVC Fittings: Use PVC couplings, elbows, and adapters of the same schedule. All joints glued. Consider expansion fittings if conduit run > 200 ft with significant temp change (NEC 352.44). Use PVC boxes or FS/FD boxes if junctions needed under slab (must be listed for direct burial and concrete-tight【43†L37-L45】).
– Straps/Supports: Underground, conduits are usually supported by stakes or tied to rebar. For conduits on formwork (vertical stub-ups), clamp or strap them so they remain plumb. Use rebar tie wire or metallic straps that will not loosen.	All fittings must match conduit type (NEC 300.6 for corrosion protection in concrete, so e.g. zinc-coated RMC and galvanized steel fittings). No dissimilar metals that could cause corrosion (e.g. don’t mix aluminum conduit in concrete with steel). Code note: PVC conduits can’t be used as the grounding path, so provide a ground wire if run is PVC (NEC 250.118). In Chicago, since metallic raceways are prevalent, the conduit often is the ground path – ensure metal conduits are bonded via connectors, threads, etc.【20†L75-L83】. Running threads on RMC are not allowed for couplings in place of proper couplings【20†L83-L90】.
Grounding Electrodes & Conductors: Rebar, Ground Rods, Copper Conductors	– Rebar (Concrete-Encased Electrode): Use existing foundation rebar (≥ 20 ft continuous of ½″ steel) or add a #4 rebar if needed. Must be encased by ≥2″ of concrete and in contact with earth (footing)【3†L75-L82】.
– Ground Rods: ¾″ × 10′ copper-clad rods (steel core). At least two rods spaced 6 ft if used (NEC 250.53(A)). Drive flush or below grade.
– Copper Ground Conductors: Typically bare copper for direct burial. Size per NEC 250.66 based on largest service conductor (for 8000 A, assuming 480 V system with parallel feeds, likely main conductors ~1500 kcmil × 4 per phase, so grounding electrode conductor might max out at 3/0 or 4/0 AWG by code). For bonding connections: use #4 AWG to bond rebar (per 250.52(A)(3)), larger (#2 or 1/0 etc.) to bond building steel or water pipe. All connections either exothermic weld, or UL-listed lugs/clamps.	NEC 250.52(A)(3) defines concrete-encased electrode (the “Ufer” ground)【32†L111-L119】; Chicago amendment generally mirrors NEC here – Chicago requires use of building steel and at least one ground rod in addition to Ufer in many cases (check Chicago Code Title 14E-250). All electrodes present must be bonded into one system (NEC 250.50)【32†L129-L137】. Ground rods must be 8 ft min length (250.52(A)(5)) and must have <25 ohm or else add a second rod (250.53(A)(2)). Use listed clamps for rebar (or Cadweld which effectively becomes a molecular bond). Any GEC splices must be irreversible (exothermic or listed crimp). In concrete, only use clamps listed for concrete encasement (they won’t corrode).
Boxes and Enclosures (Concrete Embedded)	If junction boxes or device boxes are to be embedded in slab, use cast metal boxes (usually malleable iron or aluminum FS/FD boxes with factory gaskets) or heavy-duty PVC boxes rated for direct burial. Floor boxes for power or data are usually a combo of a metal box with a leveling ring for the finish.	NEC 314 covers boxes. They must be sized appropriately (e.g., box fill if splices inside). Boxes embedded in slab must be arranged so that covers will be flush with the finished floor and must be listed for the environment (e.g., if in a wet location like a grade slab that contacts earth, the box should be UL listed for damp/wet concrete encasement). Provide concrete-tight lids during pour (usually duct tape over openings suffices if box is not pre-fitted with a lid). Chicago amendments will follow NEC here but note: Chicago often prefers metallic raceways – so likely metallic boxes too.
Miscellaneous Consumables:	– Warning Tape: Plastic detectable tape (often red with “Caution Buried Electric Line Below”) to bury 12″ above electrical conduits, required above service conductors ≥ 18″ deep【23†L85-L93】.
– Rebar Chairs/Spacers: if making duct bank cages, plastic or metal chairs to hold conduits at proper spacing in concrete.
– Vapor Barrier Coordination: Many slabs have a plastic vapor barrier; electrical conduit should typically go under the vapor barrier or the barrier must be fitted/taped around conduits (if conduit is within slab) to maintain the integrity against moisture. Check architectural specs.
– Firestopping materials: If any sleeve or penetration is left that will need sealing later (though for slab rough-in, this mostly comes into play after the pour, not now).	Chicago specific: All marking (tape, tags) and miscellaneous must not be left out – inspectors in Chicago are detail-oriented. If a spec calls for a 4 mil red warning tape, have it installed. Vapor barrier: NEC doesn’t address it, but building code does for slab moisture. If conduits penetrate the vapor barrier, seal around them to maintain it (some building inspectors check this). Firestopping isn’t applicable until walls rise, but any core drills later must be firestopped per code.
Note: All materials must be new and damage-free. Particularly for an 8000 A service, ensure conduits for the service feeders are of the correct type and size as engineered – often, parallel runs of 4″ or 5″ RMC/PVC. If PVC is used for service duct, it should be Schedule 40 minimum (Schedule 80 for risers) and very likely encased in concrete for protection as per utility company requirements (ComEd standards may mandate concrete-encased duct banks on customer side for such large services). Always cross-reference utility requirements with NEC/Chicago codes in material selection.
Tools
Using the right tools increases efficiency and safety during the rough-in. Below is a categorized list of tools, separated into required (essential) and optional/specialized tools for slab and foundation rough-in.
Layout & Measurement Tools:
Required: Tape measures (at least 25′ and 100′ lengths), chalk line, marking spray paint (bright colors for ground marking), laser level or transit level to check elevations, builder’s level or laser for large area layout, plumb bob for aligning vertical stub-ups, leveling device for floor boxes.
Optional: Total Station or GPS layout equipment (helpful on very large projects for pinpoint accuracy of stub-ups tied to building grid coordinates; often operated by a surveyor or the GC’s layout crew but extremely useful if available).
Excavation & Trenching:
Required: Shovels, trenching shovel, picks (for small adjustments or hand digging around delicate areas like existing utilities), manual post-hole digger (useful for making small pits for ground rods or deep spot checks). Access to heavy equipment like backhoe or excavator will usually be provided by excavation subcontractor, but the electrical crew should have basic hand digging tools on site.
Optional: Trencher machine (for long straight runs in open areas if doing in-house, though on large commercial jobs an excavation crew usually handles machine digging), walk-behind concrete saw (to cut slab if modifications or dowel holes needed in existing concrete).
Conduit Installation Tools:
Required: Pipe cutters and saws:
For PVC: a ratcheting PVC pipe cutter (for up to 2″), hacksaw or reciprocating saw with PVC blade for larger diameters, and deburring tool or knife to ream inside of cut PVC (remove burrs as required by code to protect wires).
For Rigid Metal: pipe cutter (heavy duty) or portable band saw to cut conduit, a power threading machine (e.g. RIDGID 300) with appropriate dies for the conduit sizes (very essential for threading RMC ends), cutting oil for threading.
Benders:
Small diameters (½″–1″ EMT/RMC or PVC): handheld or foot bender (Chicago bender for RMC or Hickey for up to ¾″ RMC).
Large diameters: hydraulic or electric conduit bender for RMC up to e.g. 2″ or 3″, and factory-made elbows for anything larger (it’s not practical to field-bend 4″ steel without heavy equipment). For PVC, a large radius heater blanket or PVC bending oven for custom bends if needed.
Pull Line & Fish Tape: Not typically used at this rough stage (since wires aren’t being pulled yet), but having fish tape or rope can help verify conduit paths (e.g., send a line through to ensure no blockages).
Levels and Squares: Torpedo level and magnetic level for checking conduit vertical/horizontal alignment, framing square to ensure 90° stubs are true.
Hammers & Pliers: Claw hammer, sledge (small one for adjusting conduit position in dirt), linesman pliers (for cutting tie wire), locking pliers or pipe wrench (to hold conduit while tightening couplings).
Wrenches: Pipe wrenches (at least two, for tightening RMC couplings opposite each other – 18″ and 24″ sizes common for 2″+ conduit), adjustable wrench for clamps and small fittings.
Solvent Cement Kit: For PVC – includes PVC cleaner/primer, PVC cement, applicator brushes, rags.
Drill and Bits: Heavy-duty drill or rotary hammer with bits for drilling formwork or concrete (for example, if you need to drill a hole in form to secure a conduit or to create a path for a ground wire). Also used to drive grounding screws or bolts.
Extension cords and lighting: Temporary lighting (headlamps or work lights) if working in dawn/dusk or in deep excavations, generators if power not on site.
Optional:
Powered trencher attachment for mini-excavator (for precise depth trenches).
Cadweld mold and shots (exothermic welding kit) – could be considered required if exothermic connections are specified for grounding, but often one kit is shared or handled by a specialist. If many Cadwelds are needed, the crew should have the proper molds for rebar-to-wire, wire-to-wire, etc. plus a propane torch to dry the mold, and personal protective gear for welding.
Vacuum or blower: to clean out conduits if debris entered, or to suck a pull line through (air blower + drag line can feed a pull string through a long run as a test).
Power drive attachments: e.g., a cordless drill attachment that can drive ground rods (some use rotary hammers with ground rod bits to drive rods faster).
Crimp tools for large grounding connectors if using irreversible crimps instead of Cadweld.
Safety & PPE Gear: (Strictly speaking, not “tools,” but essential equipment for the crew)
Required: Hard hats (especially important around overhead hoisting during rebar or concrete placement), safety glasses, ANSI-rated work gloves (for handling sharp conduit and tie wire), steel-toe boots, high-visibility vests (everyone on a commercial site in Chicago must wear hi-vis). Hearing protection for anyone using loud tools (threader, saws). If cutting or grinding RMC, use face shield in addition to glasses. For trench work: gas monitor (if any suspicion of bad atmosphere, though outdoors usually fine), and a first aid kit on site. Fall protection if entering formwork that’s deep, or harnesses if working at height (less common in slab rough stage, except maybe climbing into deep excavations).
Optional: Welding apron or jacket and face shield if doing a lot of Cadwelds (exothermic weld flash can be bright and the mold can spit out material). Rain gear for poor weather (work often continues in light rain, and being prepared keeps crew productive).
Testing Instruments:
Required: Ohmmeter or continuity tester to check bonding (for example, test that the rebar you clamped is electrically continuous to the ground rod or building steel, if possible, before pour – this can catch a loose clamp). A measuring tape or laser measurer for verifying depths and distances (mentioned in layout).
Optional: Earth ground resistance tester (fall-of-potential tester) – not usually done at this stage (usually after the grounding system is fully connected), but if the spec requires a ground resistance test of the ground grid, having one to take a preliminary reading could be helpful. Camera (even a smartphone) for documentation (photos as “tools” for QA).
Tool Logistics and Best Practices: Ensure the threading machine and bender are set up in a safe, level area (many foremen set up a dedicated “pipe fab” area on site). Use generators or temporary power safely with GFCI protection for electric tools. Maintain tools (sharp blades, charged batteries, etc.) so work isn’t slowed. For an apprentice training, emphasize organizing tools each day – e.g., keep the PVC glue from freezing (in winter Chicago conditions, PVC cement can get sluggish – store it warm), keep track of all drill bits (so they don’t end up buried in concrete!), and inspect power cords (frayed cords on job sites are an OSHA hazard).
Safety & Procedures
Safety is paramount during slab and foundation rough-in, as this phase involves heavy materials, open excavations, and coordination with multiple trades. Here we list key safety practices and procedures (including any Chicago-specific rules or emphasis):
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): All workers must wear appropriate PPE at all times. Hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are mandatory on commercial sites in Chicago. Wear gloves when handling conduits, wire ties, or concrete (to prevent cuts and chemical irritation). Steel-toe boots protect from heavy objects (like dropping a conduit or stepping on rebar). Use hearing protection when using loud tools (cutting or threading conduit). If doing Cadweld exothermic welding for grounding, use a full face shield and gloves rated for high heat, and keep others at a safe distance during the shot. Ensure PPE is in good condition (not damaged).
Trenching and Excavation Safety: Excavations present some of the most severe hazards. Follow OSHA 29 CFR 1926 Subpart P for trenching:
If a trench is 5 ft deep or more, it must have cave-in protection (sloped sides, shoring, or a trench shield box)【30†L37-L40】. For example, in Chicago’s soil (which can be clay), a typical safe slope is 1:1 (45 degrees) if not using a trench box. If space constraints prevent sloping, a trench box or shoring must be used. This is non-negotiable – inspectors (and more importantly, safety of life) demand it.
Ladders or ramps for egress must be provided in trenches ≥ 4 ft deep; a ladder every 25 ft of lateral travel is a rule of thumb【30†L7-L15】. Never jump in or out of a trench – use the ladder.
A competent person (someone who can identify hazards and has authority to correct them) should inspect trenches daily and after rain or disturbances【30†L41-L44】. If water accumulates, pump it out and do not allow workers until the trench is stable.
Keep spoil piles and equipment at least 2 ft back from the trench edge to avoid accidental collapses【30†L15-L23】 (the weight can cause a cave-in).
If working in or around trenches, everyone should be aware of the surroundings – no one stand under a load (like a bucket of dirt swinging overhead), and set up barricades or caution tape to keep others (or vehicles) from falling in.
Chicago has a keen focus on trench safety; expect surprise safety inspections on large jobs. City inspectors can shut work down if trenches are unsafe.
Underground Utility Locates: Before any digging, call 811 or the local utility locate service to mark existing utilities (gas, water, electric, telecom)【23†L59-L67】. In Chicago, this is required by law (Illinois Underground Utility Facilities Damage Prevention Act). Do this well ahead of the work (48-hour notice typically). Once utilities are marked, respect those markings. Hand-dig (with a shovel) within 18 inches of any marked utility to expose it carefully – mechanical excavation shouldn’t be used near known utilities. Many electrical contractors have tales of costly accidents hitting unmarked lines; reduce that risk with due diligence.
Working Around Rebar and Formwork: Rebar projections can be impalement hazards. Whenever possible, cap all exposed rebar ends with rebar caps (those orange plastic mushroom caps or wood trough caps) especially if someone could fall on them. While installing electrical items among rebar, take care with your footing – it’s easy to trip. If walking on formwork, be cautious of openings or penetrations. Use fall protection if working near an exposed edge where one could fall > 6 feet (for example, if you’re on top of a high wall form running a conduit, you need a harness if not protected by guardrails).
Concrete Placement Safety: During the pour, only necessary personnel should be in the area. Wet concrete is caustic – wear rubber gloves and boots if wading in it, and wash off skin immediately if contacted (to avoid cement burns). Beware of the concrete chute or pump hose swing. Hearing protection might be needed if a gas-powered concrete vibrator is running nearby. Keep your hands out of pinch points (between form and screed, etc.). If you need to guide a conduit while concrete is being vibrated, do so carefully, ensuring you maintain balance and have a clear path out. Never stand directly behind a concrete truck or in its blind spot; communicate with the driver if you’re nearby. If using a power trowel or other finishing equipment near your stub-ups, coordinate so you’re not in each other’s way.
Electrical Safety (Lockout/Tagout and Tools): At this phase, generally there aren’t live electrical circuits yet. But ensure any temporary power (like extension cords for tools) is GFCI protected – use GFCI adapters or GFCI outlets (required by OSHA for construction sites). Check cords for damage; don’t use damaged cords. If you need to work on existing electrical (for example tying into an existing service ground or moving an live feeder), follow lockout/tagout procedures – disconnect power, lock breakers, and test for absence of voltage with a multimeter before touching conductors. However, for a new construction foundation, live work is minimal. Most hazards are more construction-related than electrical, ironically, at this stage.
Heavy Lifting and Material Handling: Conduits (especially steel ones of large size) are heavy – a 10′ stick of 4″ RMC can weigh ~100 lbs. Use teamwork or machinery to carry heavy pipes. Utilize dollies or carts for moving multiple pipes. When moving prefab conduit assemblies or long runs, use proper lifting techniques (lift with legs, not back) or mechanical assistance (forklifts, cranes) if available. On a big site, coordinate with the GC’s crane if something heavy must be lowered into a trench (for instance, a big pad-mounted box might be set by a crane). Chicago union worksites often have rules about who operates machinery – electricians typically signal to operators rather than operate excavators or cranes themselves; abide by those safety protocols and only have certified operators run equipment.
Weather Considerations: Chicago weather can be extreme. In winter, cold stress is a concern: dress in layers, take warming breaks, use portable heaters (safely, with ventilation) if needed when doing detailed work like threading pipe. Snow/ice: keep work areas clear – a slip on ice carrying conduit can be dangerous. In summer, heat stress: provide water, rest periods, and shade; watch for signs of heat exhaustion especially if working in a ditch with limited airflow. Thunderstorms: if lightning is in the area, especially with long metal conduit in hand or working in an open excavation, pause work and seek shelter – do not work during lightning storms. High winds: secure loose materials (a flying piece of plywood form or conduit can injure someone).
Chicago Specific Safety Regulations: The City of Chicago may have additional site safety requirements, especially if the work affects the public way. For example, if any trench or conduit run extends into sidewalks or streets, you must have proper barricades, steel plates, signage, and perhaps a permit. Chicago’s Department of Buildings and OSHA often partner in safety enforcement; they will expect compliance with all OSHA standards (no special Chicago electrical safety amendments beyond federal OSHA, but strict enforcement). Also, large jobs often have a Site Safety Plan – electricians should be familiar with it. One local requirement: Chicago sometimes requires a “Public Way Protection Plan” if you’re digging near sidewalks【30†L25-L34】. Ensure any required fencing or scaffolding to protect pedestrians is in place if your underground work is adjacent to public areas.
Housekeeping and Injury Prevention: Good housekeeping is part of safety. Keep the work area free of unnecessary debris – e.g., bits of wire tie ends (they are sharp – pick them up), cut conduit pieces (could trip someone), tools not in use (to avoid trip hazards or being embedded in concrete by mistake!). Cover or fill small holes promptly. After backfilling, make sure ground is compacted and level to prevent twisted ankles. If using form oil or lubricants, clean spills to avoid slick spots. Mark any protruding conduit ends with flagging tape so they’re visible.
Emergency Preparedness: All crew should know the job site address (for calling 911) and the location of the nearest hospital or clinic for any injuries. A first aid kit should be on site and stocked. In event of an accident (e.g., a trench cave-in, someone struck by something), stop work and follow the site emergency plan. Always report near-misses and incidents to the foreman; this helps improve safety. On union commercial jobs in Chicago, there may also be a site safety officer – electricians must cooperate with any safety briefings, toolbox talks, or corrective actions issued.
Remember, no task is so urgent that it cannot be done safely. Foremen and journeymen should lead by example in wearing PPE and following procedures. Apprentices should be encouraged to speak up if they see something unsafe. By adhering to these safety practices, the slab rough-in phase can be completed without injury, setting a safe tone for the rest of the project.
Coordination with Other Trades
Coordinating with other trades is a fundamental part of slab and foundation rough-in. Below are coordination best practices for working around various trades, ensuring smooth progress and preventing conflicts. Each trade interaction includes timing strategies (when to engage them) and key points to address:
General Contractor / Site Supervision:
The GC orchestrates the overall schedule, so maintain close communication with them. Hold coordination meetings specifically about the slab pour schedule. For example, confirm the dates of concrete pours well in advance so you know your drop-dead deadlines for rough-in completion. Request that the GC schedule a pre-pour walk-through with all trades: walk the site with the GC (and structural/plumbing leads) the day before the pour to check that nothing is missing. Also, coordinate inspections through the GC – often they will arrange the city inspector visits, but you need to tell them when you’re ready. Timing strategy: Push to start your underground work as early as possible once the area is accessible, so if you hit unexpected snags (like an unmarked underground obstruction or a missing detail), there’s time to resolve without delaying the pour. If the pour gets delayed, everyone gets unhappy (especially on a large project where a delayed slab can throw off the whole schedule). Staying ahead of the concrete crew is crucial – aim to finish electrical rough-in a day or two before the pour, giving a cushion for inspection and fixes. Keep the GC informed in real-time about progress: e.g., “We finished laying the east wing conduits today, we’ll be ready for inspection tomorrow.” This helps them with sequencing other work (like when backfill can happen).
Excavation Crew / Civil Work:
Coordinate with excavation for trenching and backfilling operations. Best practice: Walk the trench routes with the excavation foreman before they dig, to ensure understanding of depth and width needed. For instance, if you need a 24″ wide trench for a bank of conduits, communicate that – don’t assume they know. Mark the required depth or invert if critical. When the excavators dig, be present to observe – you might catch issues (like a boulder or old foundation encountered) and can adjust conduit routing on the spot if needed. Also, discuss backfill: request that backfilling not occur until you inspect and the inspector signs off. Typically, the excavation crew will backfill once you give an all-clear. Make sure they know if you require specific backfill material (sand around conduits if specified) or if conduit needs special protection (maybe boards over shallow conduits during backfill compaction). Timing: Align your crew’s schedule so that as soon as a section of trench is dug, you’re ready to lay conduit – idle open trenches are a safety hazard and schedule waste. On big jobs, excavation may dig in phases; coordinate to complete each phase’s electrical work in the window provided. For example, they might dig all day Monday, and you lay conduits Monday afternoon/Tuesday, and they backfill Wednesday – set that cadence and verify it with the excavation foreman. Maintain clear communication via daily huddles if needed (“Tomorrow we’ll need the trench from grid 1 to 5 open, then by afternoon you can start backfilling behind us on grid 1-3”).
Concrete / Structural Crew (Rebar and Formwork):
A critical coordination: ensure your conduits and embeds do not conflict with structural elements like rebar, footings, or load paths. Before installation, review structural drawings for rebar spacing and clearance. For example, heavy foundations might have two mats of rebar – you should snake conduits between mats if possible, not displace bars. It’s often useful to physically meet with the rebar foreman: show them where your conduits will run, and they can advise if any bars might need to be moved or if you must adjust the route. Note that any rebar cutting or removal must be approved by the structural engineer – it’s a big no-no to arbitrarily cut rebar to make room for a pipe. Instead, coordinate to have rebar detailing accommodate your larger conduits (sometimes they can shift a bar or use two smaller bars around your pipe if absolutely needed). Many structural engineers allow certain conduit sizes within slabs as long as they’re within the middle third of slab thickness【7†L7-L15】 and not too close to column or footing areas. Get clarity on these limits and stick to them.
During rebar installation: It’s wise to have an electrician on site or on call while rebar is being placed. That way if the ironworkers encounter your conduit and something doesn’t fit, you can collaboratively resolve it (e.g., maybe slightly relocate a conduit or have them move a minor bar with engineer approval).
Grounding coordination: As mentioned earlier, bonding to rebar requires coordination – the ironworkers might even stub out a piece of rebar for you to connect to, if asked. Also, ensure that any embeds or inserts for electrical (like threaded inserts for grounding lugs on equipment pads or building steel connections) are given to the structural crew ahead of time.
Formwork: For wall sleeves or opening blockouts, coordinate with the carpenters setting forms. Provide them the exact type and size of sleeve (and perhaps nailers or brackets to hold it in place) and mark on their formwork where it goes. It helps to physically spray-paint or mark on the forms “ELEC SLEEVE HERE” so it’s not forgotten. Check that forms don’t shift your sleeves during pouring – maybe have someone present to adjust if needed (some crews even nail a small piece of wood across the sleeve inside form to keep it from sliding).
Timing: The rebar installation often happens concurrently with your conduit rough-in. Communicate a plan: e.g., “We will lay conduits in Area B on Wednesday morning, can your rebar crew hold off tying that area until the afternoon?” If electrical is late, rebar may get placed and make your job 10× harder (threading conduit under rebar is tough). Conversely, if you lay conduit early and leave it, the rebar folks need to not kick it around. Best scenario: work together in the same timeframe, section by section. The GC can help sequence: sometimes they let electrical in right after bottom rebar is placed but before top rebar is set, so conduits can be laid then top rebar tied after.
Fireproofing: While not directly in the slab phase, note if any steel that will later be fireproofed needs electrical attachments (like building steel ground lugs, or embedded conduit in a column). Install those before fireproofing. For example, if the spec requires a ground clamp on each column to bond it, doing it now (or at steel erection) is easier than after fireproof spray. Communicate with the fireproofing crew to leave your connection points uncovered or allow you to scrape off a small area to attach lugs (with permission). On foundation jobs, fireproofing isn’t immediate, but plan ahead for it, especially if you have riser conduits going up steel columns – you might need to leave standoffs or guides that will later be beneath fireproofing.
Plumbing and Piping:
Plumbing often has underground drains, sewers, and sumps in the slab, as well as domestic water lines. These are typically large diameter and have specific slopes (1/4″ per foot for sewage etc.), so they can’t just move easily if a conflict arises. Coordination points:
Compare plumbing underground plans with electrical. Identify crossing points or parallel runs. A best practice is to route electrical and plumbing in different horizontal planes if possible: e.g., run electrical conduits deeper (or shallower) than plumbing so that if they cross, one can go under the other with clearance. Many times, plumbing will be deeper because of slope over distance; in such cases, keep your conduits just above or to the side of plumbing lines, maintaining whatever separation is required (there isn’t a strict NEC separation between plumbing and electrical, but practical spacing to allow maintenance – you don’t want a plumber later cutting into a live conduit!).
Communicate with the plumbing foreman: “We have a 3″ PVC feeder running across this bay; where are your 4″ cast iron drains running?” Perhaps you can arrange to put your conduit 2 feet offset to avoid a cross at the same point. If crossing is unavoidable, decide who goes lower/higher. Often, electrical can momentarily dip under a pipe if needed (so long as you maintain required cover and bend radius).
Also coordinate sleeves: if the plumbers are coring a hole through the footing for a pipe, maybe you can share the opening or at least be aware of it. Conversely, if you both need sleeves in close proximity through a wall, cluster them in a planned way rather than Swiss-cheesing the concrete randomly.
Water lines: Metal water pipes entering the building will need bonding – coordinate that the plumber leaves you accessible pipe (usually after the meter inside). Also, avoid running conduits very close to hot water lines to prevent heat issues with your wiring later.
Scheduling: Plumbing underground work often happens roughly concurrently or just before electrical. It’s common for plumbing to be slightly ahead (because they have big trenches for sewers). Try to get your conduits in once the plumbers have placed their pipes so you know final positions (no guesswork). On the other hand, if you’re in first, inform them exactly where your stuff is so they don’t inadvertently install a drain right on top of your conduit. Many GCs have an underground coordination drawing nowadays – insist on one if not provided, where all under-slab MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) components are drawn together to scale.
If you foresee a congested area (e.g., a small electrical room with many conduits and also floor drains, sump pit, etc.), have a site meeting with plumbing and HVAC to hash it out. Sometimes slight re-locations (move a floor drain 1 foot over) can allow conduit bends to fit – but only if agreed before concrete.
HVAC / Mechanical Trades:
Mechanical typically has less under-slab work (most HVAC is above grade), but there could be underground storm drain piping, chill water lines, or conduit for control wiring. Large facilities might have underground ductwork or utility tunnels. Coordinate if any:
If there are underground sleeves for future mechanical pipes that you could inadvertently block with conduit – know their locations. Don’t run your conduit through an area reserved for, say, a future chiller piping route.
Fire sprinklers usually don’t go under slab (they drop from above later), so minimal conflict there.
Mechanical equipment pads: ensure you know if any pad in the slab (for heavy equipment) might conflict. For example, a big air handler might have pad that cannot have conduits running through it. Work with mechanical engineer’s drawings to avoid running conduit through mechanical pad areas; if necessary, route around or below.
If the mechanical contractor needs embeds (like duct anchors), coordinate these like any structural embed. It’s more of a GC/structural role, but be aware so you don’t place conduit right where an anchor or penetration will go.
Chilled water or steam lines: If any insulated pipes run under slab, they often require a trench. Ensure your conduits aren’t sharing a space needed for thick insulation around such pipes. If crossing them, maintain enough clearance to not compress insulation.
Fire Alarm / Low Voltage Trades:
Often, low-voltage conduits (for fire alarm, security, telecom) in slab are the responsibility of electrical as well (or coordinated with them). If there are separate low-voltage contractors coming in later, at minimum provide spare conduits or sleeves for them now. Coordination: Confirm with fire alarm designer if any smoke detectors in floor boxes or pull stations in slab that need conduit now. For telecom, if a conduit bank is needed from the utility room out, include it. Essentially, treat them as part of your scope during slab rough-in or ensure those trades inform you of their needs. It’s costly to add conduits later once concrete is placed.
Utility Company (ComEd / Electrical Utility):
Since this project has an 8,000 A service, coordination with the electrical utility (ComEd in Chicago) is huge. Typically, ComEd will specify how many conduits, what size, and route, for the service lateral. Coordination tasks:
Submit site plan to ComEd for service layout approval. They may require a concrete-encased duct bank from the property line to the service equipment. Ensure this is integrated into your plan.
Schedule any inspections by ComEd for the service conduits (they often want to inspect before you backfill the service trench, separate from city inspection).
Reserve spaces for transformer pads, switchgear vaults, etc., and coordinate those foundations with GC and utility. For example, if there is a vault in the sidewalk, coordinate your conduit approach and stub-ups into that vault according to utility standards.
The utility might have specific rules: e.g., “no more than two 90° bends in the service run, and use sweeping bends of 36″ radius” – comply with these. Also, they might specify concrete type (red dye, 3000 psi) for encasement and require reinforcing. All such details need coordination with structural if it ties into building footing or street work (if crossing under public way, permits via CDOT needed which GC usually handles).
Essentially, treat the utility as another trade to coordinate with – hold a meeting if needed with the ComEd planner/inspector on site before installation to ensure everyone agrees on the plan.
Timing Strategies Summary: To stay ahead of the concrete pour, get involved early in prep meetings. Share your timeline with trades: e.g., “Electrical will need 3 days in Area X for conduit; plumbing, please finish by then or work on Area Y while we’re in X.” Use color-coded tape or flags on site to denote different trades’ embeds to avoid confusion (e.g., red flags for electrical conduit stubs, blue for plumbing risers). Daily or weekly coordination meetings on large projects are typical – come prepared with what you did, any issues encountered, and what you need from others. For example: “Our conduit run along gridline A is in, but we hit the plumbing line a bit – we adjusted around it with an extra bend, please note that location.” This transparency helps all trades adjust as needed.
In summary, open communication, joint planning (using combined drawings or BIM if available), and mutual respect between trades are key. Many common pitfalls (like an electrical conduit ending up right through a planned plumbing drain) can be totally avoided with good coordination. A cooperative attitude – being willing to adjust if you’re made aware of others’ needs – will build goodwill. And remember, on a tough city project in Chicago, you’re all in it together to meet the schedule under the watchful eye of inspectors and the GC. Coordination is what turns a potentially chaotic slab rough-in into a smooth, orchestrated success.
Quality Control & Inspections
Quality control (QC) during the slab/foundation rough-in ensures that the installation meets design intent, code requirements, and will stand up to the pour. Inspections (both internal and by authorities) are formal checkpoints to verify this quality. Below are key QC steps, hold points for inspection, and documentation required:
QC Checkpoints & Hold Points:
Pre-Backfill / Pre-Pour Inspection (Official): As mentioned, before any concrete is poured or any trench is backfilled, an AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) inspection is required. For Chicago, this is a City Electrical Inspector who will check all under-slab conduits and grounding. Typically, this is scheduled when:
All conduits, boxes, and grounding electrodes are in place (and visible).
The conduit trenches are still open (so inspector can measure depth) or forms are open enough to see conduits in slab.
No concrete yet placed (inspector might literally walk in the trenches or look in forms).
What Inspector Checks: They will verify code compliance: correct burial depths (they may use a tape measure – e.g., see 18″ cover for PVC)【29†L247-L255】, proper conduit type (e.g., RMC under slab as required by Chicago – an inspector in Chicago would expect to see metal, not PVC, under a building slab【49†L5-L8】), that all required grounding (Ufer, etc.) is present and properly connected, and that the work matches the approved plans (if plans show 6 conduits to a panel, they want to see 6 conduits stubbed up). They also check that conduits are not damaged and that fittings are correct (concrete tight connectors where needed). Bonding is a big item: metal conduits likely need to be bonded together – the inspector might check that couplings are tight, any bushings with bonding jumpers (if required for concentric knockouts, etc.) are installed. In NEC 2023, for instance, an inspector might specifically reference Section 300.5 for burial and Section 250.50 for the grounding system continuity【32†L129-L137】. In Chicago, they may also reference Title 14E requirements like confirming PVC use only where allowed【5†L179-L187】. After a successful inspection, you’ll get a green tag or sign-off in the city’s inspection log. If there are issues, the inspector will note them (e.g., “depth inadequate for conduit run along west wall – must be 4″ deeper” or “missing bonding jumper on rebar”). You must correct these and call for re-inspection before proceeding.
Electrical Contractor Internal QC: Good foremen implement their own inspections before calling the official one. This includes:
Checking all measurements (are stub-ups at correct coordinates and height).
Ensuring no mistakes like a forgotten conduit or clamp. A common internal QC checklist: “All conduit ends capped? All required conduits installed? Grounding installed and tagged? Bends ≤ 360°? Conduit properly supported? Any plastic conduit not inadvertently used where metal required?”
Use a level to confirm stub-ups are plumb and a tape to confirm spacing (especially if prefabricated bus or gear needs them aligned exactly). It’s easier to adjust now than after concrete.
Conduit Continuity and Damage: For metal conduits, ensure continuity across couplings (usually by visual/tactile check if tight – some might even use an ohmmeter if critical ground paths). For PVC, ensure no sections are cracked or have gaps (look inside if possible or run a fish tape through long runs to feel for obstructions).
Grounding continuity: using a multimeter, you can do a quick continuity check from the rebar stub to a ground rod or between all grounding points. This isn’t an official requirement at this stage, but it verifies your connections. For example, clip one lead to the rebar (Ufer) and another to the ground rod clamp wire – near zero ohms indicates the exothermic weld is good.
Document any QC findings and fix them prior to inspection.
Concrete Placement Oversight (QC during pour): As described, having an electrician present during the pour is a QC measure to catch any movement or issues. They can do minor adjustments in real-time, which is part of quality control (ensuring the quality of final embed locations).
Post-Pour QC: After the concrete cures, do another check:
Are the floor boxes flush and level? (If an adjustment screw moved, fix it now if possible, or mark it for later fix.)
Conduit Stub Integrity: any crushed or deformed stub-ups from the pour? (Occasionally, heavy machinery or concrete pressure can oval a thin-wall conduit – less likely with rigid steel, but if something happened, note it. Small deformities can sometimes be rounded out; major ones might need that stub to be reworked by core drilling and patching later.)
As-Built Survey: For critical feeds like the 8000 A service conduits, consider doing an as-built survey: measure the exact locations and elevations of the duct bank as installed. In big projects, sometimes an engineer will want to verify that the duct bank has the proper slope or separation. Use a transit to shoot the elevation of conduit at intervals, confirm it’s as per plan (this could be part of QC if specified).
Testing: While insulation resistance tests (megging) are not typically done on empty conduits, some contractors pull a mandrel or test ball through conduits post-pour to ensure no collapse/blockage (especially in long runs or if there was any concern of something falling in). For an important duct bank, pulling a mandrel (a cylindrical piece just slightly smaller than conduit ID) through each conduit ensures nothing inside will obstruct cable pulls later. This is a quality test – if it snags, investigate why (maybe dried concrete inside, etc., which can then be remedied by drilling out or scraping).
If grounding was poured in (Ufer), you can’t test that until the electrical system is connected, but you might do a preliminary ground resistance test on rods or Ufer if curious. Official ground resistance testing might be later under commissioning, but if you have the equipment, measuring now (expect a low ohm reading due to Ufer’s effectiveness) can validate your grounding quality.
Documentation – As-Builts and Logs:
Throughout the process, maintain documentation:
As-Built Drawings: Mark up a set of plans (or use a tablet with BIM software, etc.) with any changes. For example, if you had to route a conduit differently around an obstruction, draw it in. If a stub-up moved 6″ from the plan location due to field adjustment, note that. After the pour, update these with any final measurements. These as-builts will be turned over at project’s end and are vital for maintenance and future renovations.
Inspection Reports: Keep copies of inspection sign-offs (the city inspector’s approved sticker or report). Also keep notes of any corrections you had to do; it shows due diligence.
Concrete Encasement Reports: If you did a duct bank encasement, sometimes the project specs require a compressive strength test of that concrete (since it’s structural to protecting conduits). The testing lab usually handles that via cylinders, but file away the results.
Photographs: Maintain a log of photos taken pre-pour. These can be gold later if someone needs to know “exactly where does that conduit go under the floor?” A picture with a measuring tape or a marked reference can answer it without scanning.
Grounding Tests and Continuity Logs: If you perform any electrical tests (like continuity or ground resistance), log the values, date, and method. For instance, if you do a ground rod resistance test (you might get something like 15 ohms – but combined with Ufer later will drop). Logging it provides a baseline. Some projects require a formal ground system test (e.g., <5 ohm ground) – that usually happens after all grounds are tied together, but if done now, record it.
Material Traceability: Keep records of materials used, especially for critical components. For example, note the batch/lot of the Cadweld shots or clamps in case there’s a future question of a recall or defect. Also note if any coating or treatment was applied (sometimes rebar is epoxy-coated – if you had to grind off coating to make a Ufer connection, note that spot was recoated or not).
Elevation & Location Checks:
As part of QC, especially on foreman level, do location checks:
Stub-up Elevation: If there is a target elevation (say top of conduit stub to be 4″ above finished floor), measure it. If too high, you can cut down later; if too low (below flush) that’s a problem needing immediate addressing (like chiseling out around and adding an extension post-pour).
Conduit Slope for Drainage: For exterior runs, ensure that conduits either slope to handholes or are self-draining. QC check: pour a bit of water and see which way it flows, if practical. Or a level to confirm slope direction. Water accumulation in conduits is undesirable (especially for service later).
Spacing for Thermal Expansion: Check if long straight PVC runs have expansion joints as needed (maybe none needed if encased and stable temperature; but if run across a wide area under slab with potential thermal change before pour, ensure they weren’t locked in a expanded or contracted state – minor point, but part of quality).
Bonding & Grounding Verification:
Before pour, physically verify all required bonds are in place:
Rebar (Ufer) bonded – yes, and wire is accessible.
Building steel bonded – if columns in footing, ensure that connection is made (could be via the rebar tie or a dedicated jumper).
If the spec required a test well for the ground rod (some large jobs put one ground rod in a handhole for testing), check it’s installed at correct location.
Metal conduit is properly bonded: e.g., if using PVC for most but then transitioning to RMC sweeps into equipment, ensure the RMC is bonded to the grounding system (via bushings with bonding screws or jumpers if concentric knockouts – though those will come later with equipment termination).
In Chicago, since metal conduit is prevalent, the focus is that all those metal parts are electrically continuous. NEC 250.96 and Chicago code require any non-continuous metal (like isolated stub or a piece of rebar sticking out) be bonded. QC should catch if, say, a short piece of RMC was used as a sleeve and not bonded – you might need to bond it or use plastic if it’s truly just a sleeve.
Inspection Documentation (Turnover): At the end of the foundation rough, compile the documents:
Signed inspection approval for underground.
A letter or report if any special inspection was required (sometimes structural engineers require an inspection of the Ufer ground connection as part of structural special inspections).
Photos of critical items before covering (especially for things that will never be seen again).
These go into the project’s QC file or commissioning file. They also can be used in the foreman’s report to the company – valuable for institutional knowledge (for example, note if inspector had a particular interpretation of code that might affect future jobs).
In essence, quality control in this phase is about “measure twice (or thrice), pour once.” Every conduit and grounding element should be verified in correct position and properly installed, because once the concrete is placed or trench filled, fixes become exponentially more difficult. The inspection process is there to enforce that discipline – use it to your advantage by being ready and thorough. A veteran foreman will treat the inspector as a second set of eyes to catch anything missed. By diligently following QC steps and documenting the work, you ensure a robust installation that will serve the project without issues when it comes time to energize the system.
Code References
This section compiles relevant code references from the 2023 National Electrical Code (NEC) and Chicago Electrical Code (Title 14E) that apply to slab and foundation rough-in. Where possible, specific code sections are cited to reinforce the requirements discussed above:
NEC Article 300 – General Wiring Methods:
NEC 300.5 Underground Requirements: This is the key section for depth of cover and protection of conduits under earth or concrete. Table 300.5 in the 2023 NEC specifies minimum cover for raceways by type and location【29†L247-L255】. For example, it requires 18 inches of cover for nonmetallic raceways (PVC) in “all locations not specified” (general earth burial) and 6 inches cover for rigid metal conduit in the same conditions【29†L247-L255】. It also notes that if under a building, in a raceway, the cover can be 0 (because the slab itself provides protection)【29†L249-L257】. There’s also a provision for installations under 2″ of concrete beneath a slab (like in a trench with a concrete cap); in such a case cover can be less – e.g., PVC only 12″ if under 2″ concrete in a parking area【29†L251-L259】. Practical takeaway: We followed these rules by keeping PVC at least 18″ deep outside, using RMC under slab (cover handled by concrete), etc.
NEC 300.5(D)(3) Warning Ribbon: NEC mandates that for any service conductors buried ≥18″ deep, a warning ribbon identifying electrical line must be placed in the trench 12″ above the conduits【23†L85-L93】. We have complied by including warning tape above our main service duct bank.
NEC 300.5(E) Backfill: Requires backfill material to not damage the raceway (no large rocks or debris directly on conduit). We noted using sand padding as best practice. Also 300.5(F) on protection: if a conduit emerges from grade it needs rigid metal or other protection to 18″ above grade – relevant for where our PVC transitions to above ground at building wall (we used RMC 90s).
NEC 300.6 & 300.10 Corrosion Protection and Bonding: Metal in concrete or in earth must be protected from corrosion – galvanized RMC is inherently protected, threadless connectors in concrete must be concrete-tight【20†L75-L83】. Also all metal raceways must be electrically continuous and bonded (using proper couplings, bushings)【20†L75-L83】. We ensured RMC threads are tight and likely will add bonding jumpers where needed at terminations (e.g., locknut-bushing combos with bonding screws).
NEC 300.4 Protection Against Physical Damage: Not directly cited earlier, but for example, 300.4 mandates PVC or other raceways passing through a slab or footing should have protection if needed to prevent damage from expansion/contraction or sharp edges. We provided sleeves where needed.
NEC Article 250 – Grounding and Bonding:
NEC 250.50 Grounding Electrode System: Requires that all available grounding electrodes (building steel, metal water pipe, concrete-encased electrode, ground ring, etc.) at a building be bonded together to form one system【32†L129-L137】. This is why we had to use the concrete-encased rebar (Ufer ground) – it was present, so we must include it. The code has an exception for existing buildings, but in new construction like ours, no exceptions – we incorporated the Ufer.
NEC 250.52(A)(3) Concrete-Encased Electrode (Ufer): Defines a concrete-encased electrode as at least 20 ft of ½″ rebar (or larger) or 20 ft of #4 AWG copper encased in ≥2″ of concrete and in contact with earth【32†L111-L119】. We met this by using foundation rebar. It also clarifies it can be in one or multiple pieces tied together (so long as electrically continuous)【3†L67-L75】【3†L75-L82】. We used the usual method of tying the rebar with steel wire, which counts as continuous, plus our bonding conductor to it.
NEC 250.64 & 250.66 Grounding Electrode Conductor sizing/installation: Our GEC from the rebar to the service needs to be sized per 250.66 based on service conductor size, and it must be unspliced or spliced only by irreversible means and protected if exposed. This will come into play when we actually connect the GEC to the rebar stub (likely #3/0 or 4/0 copper for an 8000 A service feeder). 250.64(C) would allow us to exothermically weld that GEC to rebar or use listed clamp (we did clamp/weld at the rebar, effectively making the rebar part of GES).
NEC 250.104 Bonding of Piping and Structural Metal: Requires metal water piping and structural steel that are likely to become energized to be bonded to the GES. We planned for bonding to structural steel (which is inherently bonded via the Ufer if rebar connects to column, but we’ll also run a bonding jumper to building steel near service as a best practice). Also any outside gas or water lines will be bonded as required when they enter (likely later, inside).
NEC 250.8 Connection methods: Requires that bonding and grounding connections be made with listed clamps, lugs, weld, etc., not just a twist of wire. We adhered by using proper UL-listed clamps for rebar/pipe (e.g., acorn clamps on rods).
NEC Chapter 3 – Wiring Methods Specifics:
NEC 344 (Rigid Metal Conduit) & EMT 358 & PVC 352: Each article has “Uses Permitted” and “Uses Not Permitted.” For example:
RMC (344) is permitted in all structural concrete and underground installs. We used RMC accordingly.
PVC (352) NEC allows underground, and even above ground in some cases, but we cross-check Chicago amendments below for local restrictions. One key NEC bit: NEC 352.10 and 352.12 outline where PVC can be used. NEC 352.12 prohibits PVC in hazardous locations, where exposed to physical damage unless Schedule 80, etc. Not an issue here, but noted. Chicago’s amendment to 352.10 we have below.
EMT (358) is not permitted in direct burial per NEC (it would corrode unless specially coated).
Bend Limits: NEC 344.24, 352.24, 358.24 each basically say: bends must not damage the conduit and must have minimum radius per Table 2, Chapter 9. That table gives specific radii; e.g., for 1″ PVC the min radius is about 9.5″, for 4″ PVC it’s much larger, etc. Also the total bends between pull points ≤ 360° (this rule appears in 344.26, 352.26, etc.)【21†L1-L4】. We followed this by limiting bends and planning pull points if needed.
NEC Article 314 – Boxes: All boxes used in slab must adhere to box fill rules and be listed for the purpose. For example, if a junction box is buried in concrete (which is allowed if accessible afterward by cover), it must be designed so concrete cannot leak into it. NEC 314.15 requires boxes in damp/wet locations to be suitable for such (concrete in contact with earth is a damp/wet location)【20†L77-L84】. We complied by using concrete-tight FS boxes for floor receptacles and by sealing all box openings during the pour.
NEC Article 230 – Services (High-Level): The service conduits we installed must meet service lateral requirements. NEC 230 doesn’t explicitly dictate raceway type underground (defaults to Chapter 3 methods), but it does require, for instance, that each service conductor set have overload protection and possibly ground-fault protection at high amperages (for 8000 A, GFPE is definitely required at the service disconnect per NEC 230.95). These come into play later, but upstream, our installation of multiple conduits is in line with NEC 230.2 (one service unless multiple allowed) – we are running parallel conduits as one service drop. We will ensure all service raceways are bonded together at the service equipment (NEC 250.94 and 250.80 require bonding of metal enclosures and raceways for service).
Chicago Electrical Code (Title 14E) Amendments: The Chicago Electrical Code is based on an earlier edition of the NEC (2017 NEC with Chicago amendments, as of 2022; an update to align with 2020/2023 NEC may be in effect by 2025). Key Chicago-specific requirements include:
Metallic Raceways Mandate: Chicago generally requires metallic raceways for most installations. In particular, PVC conduit use is restricted. Title 14E-3-352 (Modifications to NEC 352) permits PVC only in certain conditions: corrosive environments, cinder fill, underground (direct burial or encased), etc.【5†L179-L187】. It then states PVC is not permitted in other cases【5†L197-L201】. Practically, this means Chicago forbids PVC for typical above-ground work and even under slab within a building unless encased or specifically allowed. That’s why our design uses galvanized RMC under the building slab (standard practice confirmed by Chicago specs: “Under Slab on Grade: Use galvanized steel rigid metal conduit”【49†L5-L8】). We only use PVC for the exterior duct bank where direct burial is allowed by Chicago code (and even there, encasement is used for strength).
Concrete Encasement Requirements: While Chicago code allows direct-burial PVC【5†L181-L187】, many Chicago-engineered jobs still call for concrete-encased duct banks for critical feeders (like our 8000 A service) as an engineering practice. In some cases, Chicago code or ComEd standards effectively require encasement for service conduits in the public way or near foundations for protection – we adhered to this by encasing the main service conduits in concrete.
No NM or ENT, etc.: (Not directly our scenario, but noteworthy) Chicago prohibits non-metallic sheathed cable (NM/BX) and often ENT (smurf tube) in commercial work. Everything must be in conduit. So even minor things like a short run to a floor box had to be in conduit, which we’ve done (no flexible plastic raceways allowed).
Grounding and Bonding: Chicago follows NEC 250 with a few enhancements. For instance, historically Chicago required all grounding electrode conductors to be copper (no aluminum GECs even if NEC might allow in some cases) – we automatically use copper for all GECs. Chicago also emphasizes bonding of metal conduits – effectively the same as NEC but enforced strictly. In older Chicago code, the concrete-encased electrode (Ufer) was sometimes not recognized alone, and code mandated supplemental electrodes (which we have provided in the form of ground rods). Title 14E also requires bonding metal water services as in NEC. One difference: Chicago might not allow the structural steel to serve solely as the grounding electrode (some jurisdictions let building steel be an electrode if grounded by footing, etc., but Chicago tends to still require the rebar Ufer even if building steel is present).
Miscellaneous Chicago Specs: Chicago amendments often specify using threaded rigid or IMC for any underground work in or below concrete slabs on grade (which we followed) and using expansion fittings on long runs that cross building expansion joints (something to keep in mind if our slab has expansion joints – we’d need bonding jumpers across any expansion fitting as per NEC 250.98 too). Also, Chicago requires an equipment grounding conductor in flexible metal conduits (so if any were used, we’d include a green wire).
NEC Article 408 and 409 – Panelboards/Switchgear (future connection): While not directly part of our rough-in, it’s worth noting codes that will come into play due to our groundwork: NEC 408.3 requires phase arrangement and identification – when we bring those 8 sets of service conductors up later, we must keep them grouped per phase in raceways and properly identify (we planned parallel conduits accordingly). Also NEC 409 or 110 might require working space around equipment – we placed stub-ups so that later equipment will have correct clearances (e.g., not coming up under where a future transformer neutrals might conflict with anything).
In summary, our slab rough-in complies with NEC 2023 provisions on burial depth, conduit bends, and grounding electrodes, as evidenced by specific sections (e.g., NEC 300.5 for 18″ cover【29†L247-L255】, NEC 250.52(A)(3) for the Ufer ground【32†L111-L119】, NEC 250.50 requiring its use【32†L129-L137】, and the 360° bend rule【21†L1-L4】 which we respected). Furthermore, we adhered to Chicago’s Electrical Code amendments, notably using rigid metal conduit under-slab as required【49†L5-L8】 and limiting PVC to permissible underground use【5†L179-L187】. By following these codes and standards, the installation should readily pass inspection and function safely.
Labor Data
Planning and tracking labor for slab and foundation rough-in is important for training electricians (especially future foremen) to understand productivity. Below, we present typical NECA (National Electrical Contractors Association) Manual of Labor Units data for tasks relevant to this phase, along with notes on adjustment factors. Labor units are given in hours for a standard crew under “normal” conditions as defined by NECA (baseline 8-hour workday, moderate complexity). Baseline Labor Units (NECA Average, “Normal” conditions):
Installation Item	NECA Labor Unit (Hours)	Unit
3/4″ PVC conduit in trench (direct burial)	2.5 hours per 100 feet	(0.025 hr/ft)
4″ PVC conduit in trench (direct burial)	5.0 hours per 100 feet	(0.05 hr/ft)
4″ PVC conduit, concrete-encased duct bank	8.0 hours per 100 feet	(0.08 hr/ft) – extra time for spacers & pouring encasement
3/4″ Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC) in slab	4.0 hours per 100 feet	(0.04 hr/ft) – includes threading & couplings
2″ RMC in slab or trench	6.0 hours per 100 feet	(0.06 hr/ft) – larger size increases difficulty
90° Factory Elbow for 4″ conduit	0.2 hours each	(12 minutes each) – minimal labor to install prefab elbow
Field Bend (large conduit w/ hydraulic bender)	0.5 hours each	(30 minutes each) – time to set up and make a precise bend
Set and secure standard floor box	0.5 hours each	includes leveling in formwork
Large concrete-tight floor box assembly	1.5 hours each	multi-piece floor box with adjustments
Install ground rod (drive and clamp)	1.0 hour each	one rod 3/4″×10′, with one thermoweld or clamp【40†L213-L221】
Exothermic weld on rebar or rod	0.2 hours each	one Cadweld shot (prep and execute)
Connect ground wire to rebar (with clamp)	0.2 hours each	using UL listed rebar clamp (if not Cadwelded)
Bonding jumper to building steel	0.5 hours each	drill/tap hole for lug, attach jumper (if required at footing)
Coordination/meeting time (underground phase)	~0.5 hour per 1000 sq ft of slab	(planning overhead distributed)
(The above are illustrative labor units. Actual NECA MLU values might differ slightly; for instance, NECA might list 3/4″ PVC at 0.03 hr/ft. We’ve rounded for ease. Always refer to the latest NECA Manual for precise figures.) From the above, you can see for example: installing 100 feet of 3/4″ PVC in an open trench might take about 2.5 hours for a crew under ideal conditions. Larger conduit or more complex installs (like encased duct banks) take more time due to handling, alignment, and pouring concrete. Labor Adjustment Factors: NECA labor units are based on “Normal” conditions. On real job sites, many factors can raise or lower productivity. NECA provides guidance for adjusting labor units under “Difficult” or “Very Difficult” job conditions【34†L127-L135】. Key factors and their typical impacts:
Height / Elevation: Work at higher elevations slows productivity. NECA suggests adding about 5% more labor for work over 10 ft high, and 10% more for work 16–20 ft high【36†L169-L177】 (since moving materials and working on ladders/lifts takes extra time). In our slab phase, most work is at ground level, so height wasn’t an issue except perhaps climbing in and out of trenches. But later, for vertical risers, this will matter.
Congestion / Accessibility: If multiple trades are crowded in the same area or if the site is tight (lots of material in the way), productivity drops. Stacks of materials and threading through rebar can slow you down. Estimators often apply a labor factor of 1.1 (10% add) for moderately congested areas and up to 1.5 (50% add) for extremely tight or occupied areas【42†L443-L451】. Our case: working around dense rebar mats is a form of congestion – tying a conduit in a congested rebar cage is harder than an open trench, so that part of work might be “Difficult” category. Also, since we coordinated well, we tried to mitigate congestion, but realistically, slab work with other trades around has some inefficiency.
Weather Impact: Extreme cold, heat, or rain can greatly reduce productivity. Cold fingers thread pipe slower; muddy trenches are harder to work in. NECA doesn’t give one number for weather, but experience does: below freezing, expect maybe 20% loss in efficiency due to extra layers, warming up tools, etc. Hot weather similarly can cause more breaks. We planned winter work accommodations, but any such impact should be added to labor estimates if relevant.
Overtime / Multiple Shifts: Working beyond normal hours leads to fatigue. NECA data (and studies) show that 10-hour days, 5 days a week, over several weeks can cause a 15–20% productivity loss【12†L150-L158】. If you push to 7 days or 12-hour shifts, losses mount rapidly (30–40% or more)【12†L150-L158】. So if our schedule forced lots of overtime to hit the pour date, actual hours spent might exceed estimated hours. For training, apprentices should know: a job done on second shift or with lots of overtime will take more total hours than the same job done with fresh workers on normal shifts. For example, if we suddenly had to double shift to meet schedule, we’d factor that in (perhaps needing 1.2× the labor).
Crew Skill Level: NECA units assume a trained, average crew. If the crew is green (apprentices learning), productivity might be less. Conversely, a very experienced crew with good prefab could beat NECA units. As a foreman, recognize your crew’s capability and adjust expectations. (This isn’t a formal factor in NECA tables, but it’s part of knowing your company’s “factor” as EC&M article notes【34†L93-L101】【34†L119-L127】.)
Site Layout / Logistics: Large sites mean more travel time (getting material from one end to another, or walking 500 ft to a gang box). As EC&M Magazine notes, if material storage is far, consider that lost time【10†L90-L98】【10†L109-L117】. On our project, the slab area is large; we mitigated by staging conduit near work areas, but still there’s overhead in moving around. NECA might not directly quantify this, but an estimator might add a few percent for “job size/area” if it’s huge.
Duplication / Repetition: On the flip side, doing repetitive work can improve productivity. NECA calls this the “duplication factor” – e.g., installing 10 identical conduits in parallel is faster per conduit than doing one alone【36†L197-L205】. We had parallel runs (eight 4″ conduits for service); the crew likely got into a rhythm, possibly reducing labor per conduit slightly. Estimators may apply a discount for such situations in the “Normal” column.
Shift Timing: If work had to be done off-hours (night shift), labor rates might be higher and productivity lower due to challenges at night (lighting, fatigue). This could be maybe a 10-15% hit for night work even before overtime fatigue.
Seasonal Conditions: In Chicago, digging in winter (frozen ground) is slower – you’d factor that in (perhaps via equipment and labor adjustments).
Labor Unit Examples Applied:
Using baseline units, if we have, say, 300 ft of 4″ PVC duct bank encased (which we did for service), base labor = 3 × 8.0 = 24 hours. Now adjust for difficulty: it was congested (working in a trench with multiple conduits – moderate difficulty +20%), and weather was cold (+10%), and the crew did some overtime (+10%). Combined factor might be roughly 1.4. So actual might be ~34 hours for that task. This illustrates to trainees how raw units translate to job reality. Also, NECA classifies projects by difficulty: a simple one-story store might use “Normal” column, whereas a hospital might be “Difficult” (x1.15 or more), and an industrial foundry “Very Difficult” (maybe x1.3). Given an 8000 A service high-rise is a complex project, a lot of our work might fall in at least “Difficult” category overall. NECA Manual of Labor Units Usage: It’s worth noting NECA labor units already include typical inefficiencies (tool setup, moving materials, etc.) in the base number【34†L97-L105】. They assume a certain level of productivity that a reasonably organized crew can achieve. It’s the foreman’s job to either achieve or better those units by good planning, or to know when factors will prevent that and communicate/estimate accordingly. In summary, understanding these labor units and factors helps a foreman plan crew size and duration for the slab rough-in. For instance, if you calculate 1000 labor-hours for the underground phase and you have a 4-week window, you know you need about 250 hours/week. With a single shift, that might be ~7 workers (at ~36 hours/week each allowing some contingency). If conditions are very difficult, you either allocate more hours (more people or more days) or accept that it will take longer. Tracking actual hours against these units during the project is also a great learning tool – it can highlight where productivity was gained or lost (maybe our crew only used 20 hours for that duct bank, meaning 120% efficiency, great – or maybe it took 40, meaning we struggled). Labor data is not just an estimating tool but a feedback mechanism to improve future performance. An apprentice trained with this knowledge will better appreciate the impact of job conditions on how long a task takes, and a journeyman stepping into a foreman role will be able to bid and manage work more effectively, keeping both the project on schedule and labor on budget【34†L95-L104】【34†L121-L128】.
Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
Even the best plans can go awry without experience. Here we compile common pitfalls (drawn from veteran foremen’s lessons learned) encountered during slab and foundation rough-in, along with best practices to avoid them. Paying attention to these can save time, money, and massive headaches:
Pitfall: Inaccurate Layout or Mis-measurement. One of the costliest mistakes is getting a conduit stub-up in the wrong location – even by inches. For example, a conduit for a column light that ends up 18″ off-center in the slab【15†L88-L96】 may require core drilling and patching to fix. Best Practice: Double- and triple-check layout measurements from reliable reference points (grid lines or known offsets). Use surveyors or a total station for critical stub-ups. Have a second person verify key measurements as a QA step. Before the pour, do a walk-through with the drawings in hand, verifying each conduit emergence against the plan. If a mistake is caught when conduits are still exposed, it’s far easier to remedy than after concrete. Mark stub-ups with identifying tags (e.g., “Panel X” or circuit numbers) – this both confirms you have all required stubs and helps avoid confusion if multiple conduits are close together.
Pitfall: Conduits Floating or Shifting During Pour. An unsecured PVC conduit can literally float up in wet concrete, ruining your elevations, and a rigid conduit can get knocked out of alignment by a careless step. Best Practice: Secure conduits firmly. Tie conduits to rebar at regular intervals (plastic zip ties or wire for PVC, tie wire for steel conduit). For conduits in trenches, stake them or weigh them down before backfill. During the pour, assign someone to monitor critical areas (as we did). Also, cap all conduits and boxes – an uncapped conduit can fill with concrete, which is almost impossible to clean out later (leading to chipping or re-pulling that run entirely). We had all ends taped; it’s a simple step that prevents a major pitfall. After the pour, re-check that none of the stubs moved – better to notice immediately and possibly adjust while concrete is green.
Pitfall: Omitting Required Grounding/Bonding Components. It’s easy to forget something that’s not on the main electrical drawings – e.g., the building steel bond or the Ufer ground connection – especially since it might appear on a detail page or note. Missing a grounding component can fail an inspection or, worse, require costly retrofits (imagine having to drill into a foundation later to bond rebar because the Ufer was missed). Best Practice: Use a pre-pour checklist that includes all grounding elements. Cross-check the single-line diagram and specs for grounding requirements against what’s been installed. Also, engage the structural team: remind them and yourself that the rebar is part of the electrical system (NEC 250.50’s mandate)【32†L129-L137】. Mark the location of the rebar connection with spray paint on the form or a flag so it’s not forgotten. Some foremen have the practice “No pour without me personally verifying the Ufer connection.” We followed that: the foreman (or QC lead) physically inspected the Ufer clamp and ground wire continuity just before the inspector did. Redundancy here is good.
Pitfall: Too Many Bends or Difficult Cable Pulls Later. A rough-in might look fine until months later when the wire pull happens and cables get stuck because of an excessive bend or an unnoticed kink. NEC limits 360° of bends between pull points【21†L1-L4】 for a reason – more than that makes pulling very hard. Best Practice: Plan conduit routes with gentle sweeps and minimal bends. If a run is long or circuitous, design in a pull box or vault even if not explicitly called out – better to ask the engineer if one can be added than to struggle or damage wire later. Use long-radius elbows for any feeder conduit – it greatly eases pulling (and is required by many specs for big feeders). Ensure that field bends are smooth; if you crimp a pipe even slightly, redo it – a flat spot inside conduit can scrape insulation. We had one spot with multiple offsets; we combined them into one smooth sweep to stay within the 360° rule and improve pullability. Additionally, clear the conduits after pour – run a mandrel or at least a tape through to ensure no obstructions remain. This proactive step can catch a problem (like a bit of concrete or a deformity) while you still have time to address it.
Pitfall: Lack of Coordination Leading to Clashes. The horror story: on pour day, discovering the plumbing crew’s main drain is directly where you ran a bank of conduits – someone has to cut or redo something, and neither trade is happy. Or a large piece of rebar had to be cut (violating structural integrity) because an electrical conduit was placed without coordination. Best Practice: We emphasized coordination in our plan – and it truly is key. Hold coordination meetings and use composite drawings of all underground utilities. Physically walk the site with other trades. If a conflict is spotted, be flexible and solution-oriented: work out who can adjust. Often electrical conduit can move a bit easier than a gravity sewer line, so we might reroute around if needed (maintaining code compliance). Also coordinate scheduling: e.g., let plumbing get their big pipes in, then we snake our conduits around them (or vice versa depending on situation). Good coordination avoids the pitfall of rework – it is far cheaper to relocate a conduit on paper or in an open trench than to jackhammer hardened concrete to fix an omission.
Pitfall: Poor Backfilling or Concrete Consolidation around Conduits. This can cause problems like settled trenches (a safety hazard and future issue) or conduits that aren’t properly protected. Best Practice: Ensure backfill is done in layers and compacted【30†L15-L23】 – if the GC’s laborers do it, supervise closely. Improper backfill can lead to conduits being exposed by soil settling or slabs cracking if support under them wasn’t solid. For concrete encased ducts, vibrate the concrete around conduits to eliminate voids. We monitored the duct bank pour for this. If the spec calls for red dye in concrete or particular strength, verify the right mix is used (sometimes a pitfall is the wrong concrete gets poured – which could affect the conduits if, say, it shrinks excessively). Basically, treat backfilling and encasing as part of the electrical work quality: we have a stake because poorly done, it might lead to repairs we have to handle later.
Pitfall: Failing to Document Changes. During the chaos of slab work, small deviations happen. If they’re not documented, later trades or maintenance might be blindsided. E.g., an underground conduit was moved but the as-built wasn’t updated, and later someone saw-cuts the slab and hits it. Best Practice: Mark up those drawings and keep good notes. Even take measurements from two perpendicular references for each important run and stub (triangulation) and hand that in as part of as-builts. Take photos with a measuring tape visible. This way, years later, an electrician can say “Oh, according to records, there’s a conduit 4′-2″ off column line B; we better avoid that.” We ensured our plan deviations were recorded – that’s an often overlooked but crucial quality step.
Pitfall: Not Planning for Future or “What-ifs.” Maybe the current design shows 4 conduits to a manhole – but what if later they need an extra circuit? If the slab is open now, adding a spare conduit or two costs little, later it’s nearly impossible. Best Practice: Stub in spare conduits in strategic places (with owner/engineer approval). In an 8000 A service scenario, we often install an empty spare conduit alongside mains for future upgrades. We did include at least one spare in our duct bank (it wasn’t hard to do). Another future-proofing best practice: run a empty PVC spare to an open area for potential future use (like EV chargers in the parking lot someday – if you stubbed one now through the footing, you avoid core drilling later). Also, coordinate with low-voltage folks to put in any extra sleeves they might need. Forethought can turn a potential future change from a pitfall into a minor task.
Pitfall: Ignoring Thermal Expansion or Seismic Movement. Large buildings or exterior duct banks can have significant expansion/contraction. If not accounted for, conduits can crack or pull apart. Best Practice: Use expansion fittings where conduit crosses building expansion joints or long straight runs cross a significant distance. In Chicago’s climate, a 100 ft PVC run can change length a good amount between summer and winter. We installed expansion couplings on the long straight exterior run (per NEC and good practice). Also, in seismic design (less of an issue in Chicago, but if it were in a region with seismic considerations), ensure conduits that cross structural breaks have flex or expansion as needed.
Pitfall: Inadequate Communication with the Concrete Crew. Sometimes, electrical will do everything right, but during the concrete pour, a finisher might yank a conduit that was “in his way” not realizing its importance, or might finish concrete higher than a box top. Best Practice: Communicate clearly with the concrete foreman and crew. Before pour, point out: “These conduits need to remain where they are – please don’t adjust them. Those flags mark box locations – please finish around them carefully.” Perhaps have an electrician present (we did) to work with them. Also, check that the concrete crew knows about any curbs or pad recesses that affect your work (e.g., if they change slab thickness somewhere last-minute, you need to know as it could affect burial depth). Essentially, treat the concrete crew as partners – help them help you, e.g., by marking your stuff visibly and being on site to answer questions during the pour.
Best Practice: Engage in “Lessons Learned” after the pour. A veteran foreman will gather the team and discuss what went well and what didn’t. For instance, if a particular method of securing conduits proved excellent, note it to repeat next time; if a certain tool would have made things easier, get it for next time. Perhaps the team realized that checking layout one extra time prevented a disaster – reinforce that behavior. These discussions turn experiences into improved practices for future projects.
By being aware of these common pitfalls – mislayout, conduit movement, missed grounding, lack of coordination, poor documentation, etc. – and following the paired best practices, electricians can significantly reduce rework and enhance the quality and reliability of the installation. In the words of seasoned electricians: “Plan the work and work the plan – but also have a Plan B.” We applied that: thorough planning, plus contingency conduits and constant verification. For apprentices, internalizing these lessons early will pay dividends throughout their careers; for journeymen stepping up as foremen, enforcing these best practices on their jobs will build their reputation for jobs done right the first time. Finally, remember that every concrete pour “writes in stone” the outcomes of your planning and execution. By avoiding pitfalls and embracing best practices, you ensure that what gets cast into the slab is something you’ll be proud of and not have to chisel out later.

Electrical Rough-In Training Schema: Slab & Foundation Phase (Chicago Commercial – 8,000 A Service)
Phase Information
Phase Name: Slab & Foundation Rough-In. This phase encompasses all electrical installation work that must be completed in or under the building’s slab and foundations on a large-scale commercial project (e.g. high-rise or large facility in Chicago) before concrete i​

backfilled. It is a critical early phase tailored to heavy commercial jobs, where the building will have an 8,000 amp electrical service – implying very large conduit runs, extensive grounding, and close coordination with other trades. The slab/foundation rough-in sets the stage for the entire electrical system: mistakes here can be literally set in concrete, so planning and precision are paramount. Key aspects of this phase include installing main service conduits (often multiple parallel conduits for high amperage) under the slab, stub-ups for feeders and branch circuits that will emerge into the building, concrete-encased electrodes (Ufer ground), and any underground raceways or inserts needed for electrical infrastructure. It typically occurs after initial site grading and formwork placement, but before the slab or footing concrete is poured. All work in this phase must comply with the National Electrical Code (NEC) as well as Chicago Electrical Code amendments, which are based on the NEC 2020/2023 with local modifications. Phase Objectives: Ensure all necessary electrical components (conduits, sleeves, grounding) are accurately installed within the slab and foundations without conflict with structural elements or other trades. Achieve code compliance (proper burial depths, spacing, supports, etc.【29†L247-L255】) and pass inspections before the concrete pour or trench backfill. This phase is tailored to Chicago practices, meaning using appropriate materials (generally metallic conduits for int​

ch as concrete encasement of non-metallic conduits where required and robust safety measures on site). It is especially critical in a project with an 8,000 A service to correctly install the service duct bank (multiple large conduits) and grounding system, as these carry the building’s huge electrical load and fault currents.

CODELIBRARY.AMLEGAL.COM
ural, excavation, general contractor, etc.) to preempt conflicts.
Pre-Construction Planning & Coordination: Review all construction drawings (electrical, structural, architectural, plumbing) and specifications for the slab and foundation. Develop a layout plan for conduit runs, stub-up locations, ground electrode connections, and sleeves. Mark up drawings with any potential conflicts (e.g. a conduit that appears to pass through a footing or a plumbing line) and resolve them in coordination meetings. Verify code requirements for this phase – for example, minimum burial depths from NEC Table 300.5【29†L247-L255】, and that a concrete-encased electrode (Ufer ground) is indicated for the foundation per NEC 250.52(A)(3)【3†L67-L75】【3†L75-L82】. Identify all components that must be installed before concrete (conduits, boxes, embeds, bonding points). Coordination: Meet with the general contractor (GC) and site superintendent to integrate the electrical rough-in tasks into the overall schedule. Ensure the excavation crew is aware of trenching needs and depths, and the plumbing and HVAC teams have shared their under-slab pipe layouts. Agree on a sequence – for example, electrical conduits might need to go in after underground plumbing is installed (to avoid conduit being in the way of sloped sewer pipes), but before final grading and rebar. Establish a clear point of contact in each trade for on-site adjustments.
Layout and Marking: Perform a precise layout on site. Using site survey references or building gridlines, mark the locations of all major electrical elements:
Conduit routes under slab: mark centerlines or edges of trenches with spray paint or chalk.
Stub-up locations: mark where conduits must emerge (e.g. at future panel boards, floor boxes, or equipment pads). Use measured offsets from column lines or foundation edges for accuracy (e.g. “4’–6” from Gridline X to center of stub-up”).
Grounding points: identify where the grounding electrode conductor (GEC) will connect to the rebar or building steel – often at a footing near the electrical room.
Sleeves or box-outs: mark any required openings through foundation walls or grade beams for future conduit passes.
Coordination: Have the plumbing foreman review the markings with you to ensure electrical and plumbing routes do not clash (e.g. you may find a planned 4″ conduit run crosses a 6″ drain line – better to adjust now on paper than later in the field). Check with the structural team for any restrictions: for instance, are there areas of very shallow slabs or beams where conduit cannot be placed? Structural drawings or ACI guidelines typically restrict conduit size to not weaken concrete (e.g., conduit diameter should not exceed 1/3 the slab thickness【7†L7-L15】). Mark any such areas as no-conduit zones. If the building has thick mat foundations or grade beams, plan for conduits to either go under them (sleeved) or up a​

ists about underground utilities in the area).
Site Prep & Trenching: Before installing conduits, any required excavation must be done. Excavation crews or laborers will dig trenches for underground conduit runs outside or below the slab as needed. Ensure the trench follows the path you laid out and meets depth requirements:
For direct-burial conduits or duct banks, NEC Table 300.5 requires a minimum cover (top of conduit to grade) of 18″ for non-metallic conduit (PVC) and 6″ for rigid metal conduit in general open-ground areas【29†L247-L255】. (Local utility or engineering specifications may require deeper trenches for the main service duct bank; always follow the stricter requirement).
If conduits are under a future building slab, the NEC allows zero inches of cover if the conduit is encased in concrete or under a concrete slab that provides equivalent protection【29†L247-L255】. In practice, however, conduits under slabs are usually placed on grade then covered by the slab pour itself. Chicago practice typically uses rigid metal conduit for any under-slab runs within the building footprint【49†L5-L8】 for durability and code compliance.
If trenching outside the building (e.g. for service feeders from a utility transformer to the building), maintain required depth and width for the conduit bank. Use trench width sufficient for multiple conduits spaced apart or in tiers as per design.
Safety: Follow OSHA trench safety regulations for any trench deeper than 5 ft – this may require sloping the sides or using a trench box【30†L37-L40】. A “competent person” should inspect trench conditions daily【30†L41-L44】. Workers entering any trench > 4 ft should have proper access (ladder) and no one should enter an unsafely protected trench【30†L7-L15】. Also, ensure excavated soil is piled at least 2 ft away from the trench edge (spoils management). Coordination: Schedule the electrical work to begin as soon as the trench or slab area is ready. Have conduits and materials on site so that trenches aren’t left open longer than necessary (important for safety and to allow backfi​

ed). Communicate with the GC/excavation team when sections are ready for you to work in; likewise, inform them promptly when you’ve completed installing conduits in an area so they can backfill or the concrete crew can proceed. Before any backfill, an inspection (by city or engineer) may be required – coordinate the timing of this inspection with the GC and inspector to avoid delays.
Conduit Installation – Main Runs: Install the main conduits in the trenches and forms as laid out. This includes service conduits, feeder conduits, and any branch circuits that must run under the slab. Steps:
Bed the trench (if required) with a layer of sand or fine soil to protect conduits. Check spec or code: Chicago code requires backfill to be clean earth, placed and tamped in layers【30†L15-L23】, but initial bedding with sand is common best practice for PVC.
Lay out conduits starting from one end (for example, from the utility side or main electrical room) and working towards the other end. For an 8,000 A service, you might have multiple large conduits (4″, 5″ or larger) in parallel – often arranged as a duct bank. Use spacers/stand-offs if the design calls for a specific separation or tiered arrangement (particularly if the conduits will be **concrete-e​

duct bank). Ensure conduits remain at the proper elevation and spacing along the entire run.
Join conduits: For PVC, cut to length as needed (allowing for expansion joints if required by code in long runs) and use P​

ent at each coupling. Make sure to apply primer and glue as per the manufacturer’s instructions – do not skip primer (improperly glued joints are a common failure point in underground PVC【14†L205-L213】【14†L207-L214】). For Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC), cut and thread the pipes as needed (using a power threader on large sizes) and tighten all couplings fully (threadless compression couplings, if used, must be listed concrete-tight when buried in concrete【20†L75-L83】). Use anti-corrosion grease on threads if specified. Chicago Note: Under slab on grade, galvanized RMC is typically used【49†L5-L8】, so be prepared fo​
CRAFTSMAN-BOOK.COM
 threading and the weight of steel conduit. PVC may be used for exterior underground runs or if specifically allowed, but must be at correct depth and encased if required by design.
Bending: Use wide sweeps for any 90° turns up into equipment – factory long-radius elbows are preferred for service conduits to ease wire pulling later. Follow NEC bend radius rules; do not make any bend that reduces the internal diameter or exceeds 360° total between pull points【21†L1-L4】. Typically, limit to one 90° elbow in the slab/foundation portion and plan a pull box if more bends are needed. For PVC, if field bending is needed, use a heat blanket or hot box to gently heat and bend – avoid kinked or sharp bends (which violate code minimum radius). For RMC, use hydraulic benders for sizes above 1¼″ to get smooth, code-compliant bends (consult Chapter 9, Table 2 of NEC for minimum bend radii).
Elevation and Slope: Maintain proper depth. For example, if conduits need 18″ of cover, check wit​

tape and level as you install. If the conduit run is subject to drainage concern​

t banks), you might slope them slightly to manholes or pull boxes to avoid water pooling. Typically, under-slab conduits are run level unless otherwise noted.
Stub-Ups: As you near a stub-up point (where conduit turns vertical to come above slab), ensure the vertical piece is accurately located. It often helps to temporarily set the equipment pad or a template to confirm alignment. Use level and squares to keep stub-ups plumb and at correct spacing. For multiple parallel stub-ups (e.g. a bank of conduits entering a switchgear), use a spacer rack or a prefab stub-up jig to hold them in position relative to each other.
Conduit Supports: Secure conduits to stakes or rebar so they don’t move. Tie PVC conduits to rebar with wire, or use rebar stakes on either side so the conduit can be ti​

when concrete is poured. Similarly, RMC can be tied to adjacent rebar or formwork. Properly supporting conduits is critical; otherwise they may shift when concrete is poured or backfill is placed (a phenomenon where empt​

wet concrete if not secured). Support spacing should follow code (e.g., PVC typically every 3 ft when straight in trench bottom, RMC every 10 ft, etc.), but in a slab pour scenario, more frequent tie-down (every few feet or at every rebar intersection) is wise.
Coordination: During conduit installation, maintain communication with the site superintendent about timeline – e.g., “We will have all conduits in Section A ready for inspection by Thursday.” If any plum​

ical lines still need to go in the same area, coordinate the sequence (you may have to pause while a large plumbing trap is installed, or ask them to leave an opening for your conduit). Work especially closely with the excavation team if they are on site: they can adjust trench depth on the fly if you find a conflict (like hitting unexpected debris or needing a bit more depth for conduit clearance). Also coordinate with utility provider (ComEd) if the service conduits require their inspection or if they have specs (often, utility companies require conduits in concrete duct banks for service feeders, with specific spacers and concrete mixtures – ensure these requirements are met and get sign-off from the utility representative as needed).

Coordination with the excavation crew and proper support for conduits (note the spacer racks keeping conduits aligned) are critical to maintain design spacing before concrete encasement or backfill.
Grounding Installation – Concrete-Encased Electrode (Ufer) and Grounding Grid: In parallel with conduit installation, install all grounding components that must go into the concrete or earth:
Concrete-Encased Electrode (Ufer Ground): For a new building in Chicago, the foundation reinforcing steel will serve as a concrete-encased grounding electrode as required by NEC 250.50 and 250.52(A)(3). Identify a section of the footing or foundation where the main electrical room is nearby. You need **at least 20 ft of continu​

½″ diameter or larger) to bond as the Ufer【32†L111-L119】. Typically, one of the footing rebars is designated; if multiple rebars are used, they must be tied together to total ≥20 ft. Procedure: Remove any non-conductive form ties or coatings on that rebar section. Attach a bonding conductor (usually a bare copper wire, #4 AWG minimum for a Ufer per code) to the rebar. This is often done with a listed rebar clamp or by exothermic welding (Cadweld). The connection must be accessible or brought out of the concrete in a way that it can be connected to the rest of the grounding system. A common method is to Cadweld a #4 AWG copper lead onto the rebar and have about 6–8 feet of that copper wire stubbed out of the side of the footing (protected by a piece of conduit or forming a small recess) so it can connect to the main grounding electrode conductor later. Coordination: Communicate with the rebar placing crew – let them know which rebar needs a clamp or weld. Often the electrical foreman will go in after rebar is tied to do this connection before concrete pour, or sometimes the rebar subcontractor will install a clamp under your guidance. Ensure the point where the wire exits the concrete will not interfere with foundation forms or post-pour finishes.
Ground Rods or Ground Ring (if required): Check the electrical specs – sometimes in addition to the Ufer, a ground​

​

ound the foundation is required (NEC 250.52(A)(4) ground ring, etc.). If ground rods are needed (say near the main service entrance or building perimeter), drive them now before slabs or paving cover the area. A typical ground rod is 3/4″ x 10′ copper-clad steel, driven flush or below grade. Space multiple rods at least 6 ft apart【3†L33-L41】. After driving, attach a bonding jumper (e.g. #3/0 AWG copper for a large service ground) with an irreversible clamp or Cadweld. If a ground ring is used (buried loop of #2 AWG bare copper around the building perimeter), t​
FORUMS.MIKEHOLT.COM
 ft deep around the footing and lay the bare copper, cadwelding or clamping to ground rods at corners as needed. Note: In many large buildings, the Ufer ground (rebar) combined with building steel and water pipe bonds will suffice, but always follow the design – some engineers belt-and-suspenders with additional electrodes.
Bonding to Structural Steel: In Chicago high-rises or large facilities, the structural steel (building frame) must be bonded to the grounding electrode system as well (NEC 250.104(C)). If there are column base plates or embedded steel columns in the foundation pour, prepare to bond them. Often a piece of rebar connected to the column anchor bolts is tied to the rest of the rebar mat – that effectively bonds the steel frame to the Ufer. Alternatively, you may run a bonding jumper from the column (or anchor bolt) to the rebar. Coordinate with the structural team so that any required lug or plate for grounding is in place: for example, some projects weld a lug onto a steel column at ground level for the grounding conductor. If that’s the case, ensure it’s done prior to fireproofing and is accessible.
Underground Metallic Pipes: If there are other underground metallic systems going in (like a site’s metal water service pipe entering through the footing), plan to bond that too as required by code (NEC 250.104(A) for water piping). It’s easier now to clamp a conductor onto a water pipe before everything is buried. The bonding conductor for water pipe must be sized per 250.66 (likely large – for 8000 A service it could be 3/0 or 4/0 copper depending on system grounding). Coordinate with plumbers to ensure a bonding clamp is attached to the water line (on the street side of the meter typically, but that might be later inside – however, if the water entry is through the foundation, you can at least stub a bond wire through with it).
After installing these, leave visible tags or spray paint indicating these critical connections for the inspector to see. For example, you might flag the rebar with tape labeled “Electrical Ufer Ground” so it’s not overlooked. Inspection Hold-Point: The bonding of the concrete-encased electrode must be inspected before the concrete is poured (NEC 250.50 requires that you use any available electrode, so the inspector will want

did it)【32†L129-L137】. Typically, the city inspector will check the Ufer connection on the structural inspection or a dedicated electrical rough-in inspection for underground. Make sure to schedule this inspection with enough lead time. Have the electrician or foreman on site to explain the grounding system to the inspector if needed.
Installation of Boxes, Inserts, and Sleeves: As part of the rough-in, place any required electrical boxes or sleeves that need to be embedded in the concrete:
Floor Boxes: If the design calls for floor outlets or junction boxes flush with the slab (common in l​
MIKEHOLT.COM
areas or lobbies), install the box on its mounting stems or trim so that its top will sit flush with the finished concrete floor. Use adjustable floor boxes if possible, which allow fine-tuning the height. Secure boxes to the formwork or rebar so they do not move during concrete placement. Conduits feeding these floor boxes should already be in place (bend up into the box). Double-check the location and levelness of each floor box (using a laser level or measuring down from a reference string). A best practice is to pour a small “mud pad” or use concrete brick supports under the box to ensure it stays at correct height. Coordination: Work with the architectural plan for exact locations – often the GC will help locate these in the field with you to ensure they align with room layouts, furniture, etc.
Wall Sleeves: If conduits need to pass through foundation walls or grade beams (for example, conduits going out to exterior site lighting or the utility transformer pad), install sleeves before concrete pour. Sleeves can be short pieces of PVC or steel pipe slightly larger than the conduits that will go through them. They are set in the formwork of the wall so that once the wall is poured and forms removed, you have a clear path to later run conduits. Seal the ends of sleeves (tape or plastic caps) to keep concrete out. Mark their positions on the outside of the forms for reference. For an 8,000 A service, typically 4–6 large conduit sleeves might be needed through the foundation wall to the outside utility area – ensure the spacing and grouping matches the electrical plan.
Conduit Stub-Ups and Stubs-Out: For every conduit that will later connect to equipment above the slab, ensure it is stubbed out to the correct spot:
Stub-ups (vertical): These are conduits that will come up through the slab into walls, cabinets, or equipment. Cut them to extend above the finished floor by a safe margin (e.g. 6″–12″, unless plans say flush). It’s easier to cut a little excess off later than to be too short. Group stub-ups that go to the same panel or area and label them if possible (with a paint marker or tag indicating e.g. “Panel DP feeds”). If stub-ups are in the way of the concrete finishing, coordinate to have them cut to just above slab and capped – but make sure you can find them later! (Pro tip: 
CODELIBRARY.AMLEGAL.COM
 two perpendicular reference points and record the location of each important stub-up on an as-built drawing, in case they get buried in subfloor or toppings.)
Stubs-out (horizontal): These are conduits that exit the edge of a slab or footing to continue later (perhaps to feed another building or outdoor equipment). They should extend past the concrete enough to be accessible (typically several feet beyond the pour) and be capped. Often, stubs-out are encased in the concrete for a short distance. Make sure they have the required cover once outside (e.g., if they immediately go underground outside the foundation, they still need 18″ cover or concrete encasement as per 300.5). Use 45° bends where a conduit transitions from in-slab to underground outside, to reduce stress points.
Concrete Encasement for Duct Banks: For the main service conduits (especially non-metallic), the design may call for them to be encased in concrete (RNC (PVC) conduits often need a concrete envelope for physical protection when carrying very high current). If so, you will create a mini-form or use the trench itself to pour concrete around the conduits. Ensure spacers are in place to maintain separation and proper concrete thickness around each conduit (typically at least 3″ of concrete cover around duct bank conduits). You might embed rebar or wire mesh in this encasement (“red concrete” is often specified for electrical duct banks to differentiate them from other concrete). This encasement is usually poured after the conduits are installed and inspected but before final backfill. Plan the logistics: ready-mix concrete trucks or site-mixed? Where will you pour from? etc. Coordination: with GC and structural if encasement interacts with the foundation (e.g., sometimes the duct bank encasement may tie into a foundation wall).
【48†embed_image】 Conduits stubbed up along a foundation wall for connection to future electrical equipment. Precise layout and secure strapping keep these conduits correctly spaced and plumb prior to the pour, preventing costly misalignments. In practice, each conduit’s location is measured and verified to align with equipment requirements.
Quality Checks and Pre-Pour Inspection Prep: Once all conduits, grounding, and embeds are in place, perform thorough self-inspections prior to calling the official inspector:
Conduit Continuity & Spacing: Walk every run to ensure couplings are tight and conduits have not been dislodged. Verify that parallel conduits in banks are evenly spaced and will not encroach into where concrete cover is too thin. (If any conduit ended up closer than 2″ to the surface of concrete, add protective measures or inform structural engineer – e.g. in a 5″ slab, keep conduits at least 1.5″ below top to have adequate cover and to not conflict with slab saw-cut joints).
Depth Verification: Measure cover depth at random spots for buried conduits – ensure minimum cover (e.g., ≥18″ for PVC) is met【29†L247-L255】. Check any “under slab but not in concrete” runs: they should either be under 4″ of concrete or meet the direct burial depth; under building slabs, code is more lenient (0″ cover allowed if under concrete)【29†L249-L257】, but Chicago practice still often requires those conduits be in RMC for physical protection【49†L5-L8】.
Grounding Connections: Verify that the rebar connection (Ufer) is secure (the clamp tightened or Cadweld executed properly) and that the grounding tail is accessible. Verify ground rods are at correct depth (top ~below grade) and attached. Ensure all these are clearly visible for inspection – do not backfill over a ground rod or bury the Ufer clamp in concrete without sign-off.
Bolt Down and Tagging: Make sure any required identification is in place – for example, some specs require plastic tag markers on conduits for what circuit they are (helpful for complex layouts to avoid confusion later). Also ensure conduit ends are capped or taped to prevent concrete from entering. This includes stub-ups (tape them closed or use plastic caps) and any sleeves. It’s amazing how easily wet concrete or debris can find its way into an open pipe and create a blockage.
Photos and As-Builts: Take photos of the installation in case any issues arise later (especially documenting the layout of conduits before pour – useful for future reference or if something gets covered accidentally). Update your as-built drawings with any changes from plan (perhaps you had to route a conduit differently to avoid an unexpected obstruction – mark it).
Prepare for Inspection: Have one set of drawings on site with the installed condition highlighted. Be ready to explain to the inspector how the installation meets code. Common inspection points: proper burial depth (they may physically measure trench depth), conduit type approval (e.g., “is that Schedule 40 PVC? – Yes, here’s the marking.”), spacing of parallel service conduits (to ensure proper derating if not far enough apart, etc.), correct grounding electrode present, and if required, warning tape above service conductors (NEC 300.5(D)(3) requires a warning ribbon 12″ above buried service lines【23†L85-L93】).
Official Inspection: The electrical inspector (and possibly a structural inspector for the footing) will look at the work now. Typical hold points before pouring concrete or backfilling:
Underground conduit inspection (trench open, conduits in place) – the inspector checks depth and that the correct material is used, and that proper support or encasement is ready. In Chicago, they will also confirm you used RMC where required (under buildi​

ff to proceed. Coordination: Make sure the GC knows you have either passed inspection or if any corrections are needed. Do not pour or backfill until all required inspections are passed.
Concrete Pour and During-Pour Vigilance: Although the concrete placement is typically performed by the concrete crew, the electrical team should be present when the slab or encasement is being poured. Assign one or more electricians to:
Monitor that conduit and box positions remain correct as the pour progresses. If workers are stepping near conduits or the force of concrete moves something, gently alert the pour crew or adjust it back in place (using a hook or tape on a rod to pull a conduit that’s shifting – carefully and only if safe).
Ensure that no conduits are damaged by vibrators (the concrete vibration equipment). Floor boxes should have their lids on or taped over to avoid concrete infiltration; watch that the vibration doesn’t push a box deeper or knock off a cap.
If concrete encasement of duct bank is happening, ensure the concrete flows around and under the conduits (no voids). Sometimes you’ll need to lightly shovel or prod to get concrete fully under the bottom conduits of a duct bank. The goal is a solid monolithic encasement with no air pockets.
After pour, while concrete is still workable, double-check critical stub-up alignments and adjust if needed (it’s much easier to nudge a conduit a half inch now than to chip concrete later!). Also, trowel around conduits or boxes that need a smooth finish (the concrete finisher may not know the exact required clearances around a conduit stub).
Safety: During pour, wear appropriate PPE (rubber boots, gloves, safety glasses). Be mindful of not getting trapped by concrete or bumping into finishing equipment.
Post-Pour Wrap Up: Once the slab or encasements are poured and set, do a follow-up:
Survey of Stub-Ups: Immediately after the pour (and over the next day or two), verify that all expected stub-ups are indeed present and visible. Sometimes formwork or dirt can obscure a conduit stub – find them now before they are lost. If any were missed or buried, act quickly to locate and expose them if possible (before the concrete fully cures – early in the curing, concrete can be chipped out more easily around a lost conduit end). Hopefully, with good planning, this doesn’t happen, but a thorough check is necessary.
Remove any temporary bracing: e.g., wood forms that held boxes, and clean off any debris. For encased duct banks, once the encasement is cured, you can remove temporary spacer ties that protruded.
Backfilling: If not already done, trenches can be backfilled after any required curing time. Use proper backfill techniques per code (layered compaction)【30†L15-L23】 to avoid settlement. Make sure warning tape (metallic detectable tape) is placed about 1 ft above buried service conduits【23†L85-L93】 before final backfill, as required by NEC for service conductors.
Record Updating: Finalize the as-built documentation for this phase. This includes noting exact locations of concealed items (e.g., “20′ Ufer ground wire exit at NW corner of footing 12″ below top of wall”), and any deviations. This info will be crucial for future trades and for troubleshooting (for instance, when the time comes to connect the grounding electrode conductor to that rebar end, you’ll consult these notes to know where it is).
At this point, the slab and foundation rough-in should be complete, allowing other trades to continue with minimal interference. The next electrical phase would be wall rough-in and feeders installation as the structure is built, but the groundwork laid here ensures those later stages go smoothly.
Materials
Selecting the correct materials for slab and foundation rough-in is crucial for code compliance and longevity. Below is a breakdown of common materials, including specifications and any code/standards notes (especially Chicago-specific notes). All materials must be listed for their use and meet NEC and Chicago Electrical Code requirements.
Material	Specification & Use	Code / Standards Notes
Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC) – Galvanized Steel	Heavy-wall steel conduit, hot-dip galvanized. Used for under-slab and underground runs especially within building footprint. All joints are threaded. Provides excellent physical protection and serves as a grounding conductor.	Required by Chicago for any under slab on grade conduit runs inside buildings【49†L5-L8】 (PVC not allowed under building slab without encasement). NEC Article 344 governs RMC; it allows RMC in all locations including wet and concrete-encased – threadless connectors must be concrete-tight for slab embeds【20†L75-L83】. Offers a low-impedance ground path when couplings are wrench-tight (NEC 250.4(A)(5), 300.10). Minimum burial depth 6″ if RMC is used underground in earth (NEC Table 300.5)【29†L247-L255】.
PVC Conduit (Schedule 40/80 PVC) – Rigid Nonmetallic Conduit (RNC)	Non-metallic PVC conduit, typically Schedule 40 for general underground use or Schedule 80 for areas subject to damage. Lightweight and corrosion-proof. Used for underground exterior runs such as duct banks from building to utility, or encased within concrete slabs in some cases. Solvent-cemented joints.	NEC Article 352 for PVC. NEC permits PVC underground (direct burial or encased) and in concrete. Chicago amendment 14E-3-352 explicitly permits PVC conduit for underground installations (direct burial or encased)【5†L179-L187】, but PVC is not permitted in other areas not listed in that section【5†L197-L201】 (meaning Chicago generally forbids PVC above grade or indoors except maybe in special corrosive areas). Under a building slab, Chicago practice is to use RMC, but PVC could be allowed if it’s deep in earth under the slab or encased – always check local AHJ preference. Minimum burial depth 18″ for direct burial PVC per NEC Table 300.5【29†L247-L255】. PVC must be supported to prevent movement during pour and expansion joints used if long runs span temperature change areas (NEC 352.44). All PVC elbows in slab should be long radius and schedule 80 if emerging from ground for better strength.
Electrical Metallic Tubing (EMT) – Steel conduit (thin-wall)	Not usually used for direct burial or encasement (EMT is thin and not threaded). EMT is sometimes used within slab for short runs like floor boxes in a protected interior environment (if allowed by code), but in Chicago, EMT is not recognized for underground or in concrete that’s in contact with earth – code limits EMT to above grade, dry or wet locations but not direct burial.	NEC Article 358 for EMT. Chicago Electrical Code generally requires RMC or Intermediate Metal Conduit for anything in concrete or underground; EMT is not permitted in direct burial and would rust if buried. Only mention: use RMC instead of EMT for slab work in Chicago. (EMT might be used above slab in walls later).
Flexible Conduit (FMC or LFMC)	Flexible metal conduit (Greenfield) or Liquidtight flexible (LFMC) generally should be avoided in slabs. They are not suitable for encasing in concrete (FMC is not liquidtight or corrosive-resistant for concrete, and LFMC is allowed in concrete only if listed for it, typically short sections).	NEC 348 & 350. FMC cannot be in wet locations (thus not in slabs that are on grade), LFMC can be in wet but physical damage risk is high【20†L103-L112】【20†L107-L115】. Not a typical material for this phase except possibly a short whip to an island if absolutely needed and local code allows (Chicago would likely not allow at all in slab). Best practice: use rigid conduit instead.
Conduit Fittings & Supports	– Rigid Conduit Fittings: Use threaded couplings and elbows for RMC. Where RMC is embedded in concrete, use concrete-tight couplings/connectors (usually the standard threaded ones are fine; avoid set-screw types entirely in slab). Plastic bushings on conduit ends to protect wires (NEC 344.46 requires bushings on conduit ≥ 4 AWG)【20†L87-L94】.
– PVC Fittings: Use PVC couplings, elbows, and adapters of the same schedule. All joints glued. Consider expansion fittings if conduit run > 200 ft with significant temp change (NEC 352.44). Use PVC boxes or FS/FD boxes if junctions needed under slab (must be listed for direct burial and concrete-tight【43†L37-L45】).
– Straps/Supports: Underground, conduits are usually supported by stakes or tied to rebar. For conduits on formwork (vertical stub-ups), clamp or strap them so they remain plumb. Use rebar tie wire or metallic straps that will not loosen.	All fittings must match conduit type (NEC 300.6 for corrosion protection in concrete, so e.g. zinc-coated RMC and galvanized steel fittings). No dissimilar metals that could cause corrosion (e.g. don’t mix aluminum conduit in concrete with steel). Code note: PVC conduits can’t be used as the grounding path, so provide a ground wire if run is PVC (NEC 250.118). In Chicago, since metallic raceways are prevalent, the conduit often is the ground path – ensure metal conduits are bonded via connectors, threads, etc.【20†L75-L83】. Running threads on RMC are not allowed for couplings in place of proper couplings【20†L83-L90】.
Grounding Electrodes & Conductors: Rebar, Ground Rods, Copper Conductors	– Rebar (Concrete-Encased Electrode): Use existing foundation rebar (≥ 20 ft continuous of ½″ steel) or add a #4 rebar if needed. Must be encased by ≥2″ of concrete and in contact with earth (footing)【3†L75-L82】.
– Ground Rods: ¾″ × 10′ copper-clad rods (steel core). At least two rods spaced 6 ft if used (NEC 250.53(A)). Drive flush or below grade.
– Copper Ground Conductors: Typically bare copper for direct burial. Size per NEC 250.66 based on largest service conductor (for 8000 A, assuming 480 V system with parallel feeds, likely main conductors ~1500 kcmil × 4 per phase, so grounding electrode conductor might max out at 3/0 or 4/0 AWG by code). For bonding connections: use #4 AWG to bond rebar (per 250.52(A)(3)), larger (#2 or 1/0 etc.) to bond building steel or water pipe. All connections either exothermic weld, or UL-listed lugs/clamps.	NEC 250.52(A)(3) defines concrete-encased electrode (the “Ufer” ground)【32†L111-L119】; Chicago amendment generally mirrors NEC here – Chicago requires use of building steel and at least one ground rod in addition to Ufer in many cases (check Chicago Code Title 14E-250). All electrodes present must be bonded into one system (NEC 250.50)【32†L129-L137】. Ground rods must be 8 ft min length (250.52(A)(5)) and must have <25 ohm or else add a second rod (250.53(A)(2)). Use listed clamps for rebar (or Cadweld which effectively becomes a molecular bond). Any GEC splices must be irreversible (exothermic or listed crimp). In concrete, only use clamps listed for concrete encasement (they won’t corrode).
Boxes and Enclosures (Concrete Embedded)	If junction boxes or device boxes are to be embedded in slab, use cast metal boxes (usually malleable iron or aluminum FS/FD boxes with factory gaskets) or heavy-duty PVC boxes rated for direct burial. Floor boxes for power or data are usually a combo of a metal box with a leveling ring for the finish.	NEC 314 covers boxes. They must be sized appropriately (e.g., box fill if splices inside). Boxes embedded in slab must be arranged so that covers will be flush with the finished floor and must be listed for the environment (e.g., if in a wet location like a grade slab that contacts earth, the box should be UL listed for damp/wet concrete encasement). Provide concrete-tight lids during pour (usually duct tape over openings suffices if box is not pre-fitted with a lid). Chicago amendments will follow NEC here but note: Chicago often prefers metallic raceways – so likely metallic boxes too.
Miscellaneous Consumables:	– Warning Tape: Plastic detectable tape (often red with “Caution Buried Electric Line Below”) to bury 12″ above electrical conduits, required above service conductors ≥ 18″ deep【23†L85-L93】.
– Rebar Chairs/Spacers: if making duct bank cages, plastic or metal chairs to hold conduits at proper spacing in concrete.
– Vapor Barrier Coordination: Many slabs have a plastic vapor barrier; electrical conduit should typically go under the vapor barrier or the barrier must be fitted/taped around conduits (if conduit is within slab) to maintain the integrity against moisture. Check architectural specs.
– Firestopping materials: If any sleeve or penetration is left that will need sealing later (though for slab rough-in, this mostly comes into play after the pour, not now).	Chicago specific: All marking (tape, tags) and miscellaneous must not be left out – inspectors in Chicago are detail-oriented. If a spec calls for a 4 mil red warning tape, have it installed. Vapor barrier: NEC doesn’t address it, but building code does for slab moisture. If conduits penetrate the vapor barrier, seal around them to maintain it (some building inspectors check this). Firestopping isn’t applicable until walls rise, but any core drills later must be firestopped per code.
Note: All materials must be new and damage-free. Particularly for an 8000 A service, ensure conduits for the service feeders are of the correct type and size as engineered – often, parallel runs of 4″ or 5″ RMC/PVC. If PVC is used for service duct, it should be Schedule 40 minimum (Schedule 80 for risers) and very likely encased in concrete for protection as per utility company requirements (ComEd standards may mandate concrete-encased duct banks on customer side for such large services). Always cross-reference utility requirements with NEC/Chicago codes in material selection.
Tools
Using the right tools increases efficiency and safety during the rough-in. Below is a categorized list of tools, separated into required (essential) and optional/specialized tools for slab and foundation rough-in.
Layout & Measurement Tools:
Required: Tape measures (at least 25′ and 100′ lengths), chalk line, marking spray paint (bright colors for ground marking), laser level or transit level to check elevations, builder’s level or laser for large area layout, plumb bob for aligning vertical stub-ups, leveling device for floor boxes.
Optional: Total Station or GPS layout equipment (helpful on very large projects for pinpoint accuracy of stub-ups tied to building grid coordinates; often operated by a surveyor or the GC’s layout crew but extremely useful if available).
Excavation & Trenching:
Required: Shovels, trenching shovel, picks (for small adjustments or hand digging around delicate areas like existing utilities), manual post-hole digger (useful for making small pits for ground rods or deep spot checks). Access to heavy equipment like backhoe or excavator will usually be provided by excavation subcontractor, but the electrical crew should have basic hand digging tools on site.
Optional: Trencher machine (for long straight runs in open areas if doing in-house, though on large commercial jobs an excavation crew usually handles machine digging), walk-behind concrete saw (to cut slab if modifications or dowel holes needed in existing concrete).
Conduit Installation Tools:
Required: Pipe cutters and saws:
For PVC: a ratcheting PVC pipe cutter (for up to 2″), hacksaw or reciprocating saw with PVC blade for larger diameters, and deburring tool or knife to ream inside of cut PVC (remove burrs as required by code to protect wires).
For Rigid Metal: pipe cutter (heavy duty) or portable band saw to cut conduit, a power threading machine (e.g. RIDGID 300) with appropriate dies for the conduit sizes (very essential for threading RMC ends), cutting oil for threading.
Benders:
Small diameters (½″–1″ EMT/RMC or PVC): handheld or foot bender (Chicago bender for RMC or Hickey for up to ¾″ RMC).
Large diameters: hydraulic or electric conduit bender for RMC up to e.g. 2″ or 3″, and factory-made elbows for anything larger (it’s not practical to field-bend 4″ steel without heavy equipment). For PVC, a large radius heater blanket or PVC bending oven for custom bends if needed.
Pull Line & Fish Tape: Not typically used at this rough stage (since wires aren’t being pulled yet), but having fish tape or rope can help verify conduit paths (e.g., send a line through to ensure no blockages).
Levels and Squares: Torpedo level and magnetic level for checking conduit vertical/horizontal alignment, framing square to ensure 90° stubs are true.
Hammers & Pliers: Claw hammer, sledge (small one for adjusting conduit position in dirt), linesman pliers (for cutting tie wire), locking pliers or pipe wrench (to hold conduit while tightening couplings).
Wrenches: Pipe wrenches (at least two, for tightening RMC couplings opposite each other – 18″ and 24″ sizes common for 2″+ conduit), adjustable wrench for clamps and small fittings.
Solvent Cement Kit: For PVC – includes PVC cleaner/primer, PVC cement, applicator brushes, rags.
Drill and Bits: Heavy-duty drill or rotary hammer with bits for drilling formwork or concrete (for example, if you need to drill a hole in form to secure a conduit or to create a path for a ground wire). Also used to drive grounding screws or bolts.
Extension cords and lighting: Temporary lighting (headlamps or work lights) if working in dawn/dusk or in deep excavations, generators if power not on site.
Optional:
Powered trencher attachment for mini-excavator (for precise depth trenches).
Cadweld mold and shots (exothermic welding kit) – could be considered required if exothermic connections are specified for grounding, but often one kit is shared or handled by a specialist. If many Cadwelds are needed, the crew should have the proper molds for rebar-to-wire, wire-to-wire, etc. plus a propane torch to dry the mold, and personal protective gear for welding.
Vacuum or blower: to clean out conduits if debris entered, or to suck a pull line through (air blower + drag line can feed a pull string through a long run as a test).
Power drive attachments: e.g., a cordless drill attachment that can drive ground rods (some use rotary hammers with ground rod bits to drive rods faster).
Crimp tools for large grounding connectors if using irreversible crimps instead of Cadweld.
Safety & PPE Gear: (Strictly speaking, not “tools,” but essential equipment for the crew)
Required: Hard hats (especially important around overhead hoisting during rebar or concrete placement), safety glasses, ANSI-rated work gloves (for handling sharp conduit and tie wire), steel-toe boots, high-visibility vests (everyone on a commercial site in Chicago must wear hi-vis). Hearing protection for anyone using loud tools (threader, saws). If cutting or grinding RMC, use face shield in addition to glasses. For trench work: gas monitor (if any suspicion of bad atmosphere, though outdoors usually fine), and a first aid kit on site. Fall protection if entering formwork that’s deep, or harnesses if working at height (less common in slab rough stage, except maybe climbing into deep excavations).
Optional: Welding apron or jacket and face shield if doing a lot of Cadwelds (exothermic weld flash can be bright and the mold can spit out material). Rain gear for poor weather (work often continues in light rain, and being prepared keeps crew productive).
Testing Instruments:
Required: Ohmmeter or continuity tester to check bonding (for example, test that the rebar you clamped is electrically continuous to the ground rod or building steel, if possible, before pour – this can catch a loose clamp). A measuring tape or laser measurer for verifying depths and distances (mentioned in layout).
Optional: Earth ground resistance tester (fall-of-potential tester) – not usually done at this stage (usually after the grounding system is fully connected), but if the spec requires a ground resistance test of the ground grid, having one to take a preliminary reading could be helpful. Camera (even a smartphone) for documentation (photos as “tools” for QA).
Tool Logistics and Best Practices: Ensure the threading machine and bender are set up in a safe, level area (many foremen set up a dedicated “pipe fab” area on site). Use generators or temporary power safely with GFCI protection for electric tools. Maintain tools (sharp blades, charged batteries, etc.) so work isn’t slowed. For an apprentice training, emphasize organizing tools each day – e.g., keep the PVC glue from freezing (in winter Chicago conditions, PVC cement can get sluggish – store it warm), keep track of all drill bits (so they don’t end up buried in concrete!), and inspect power cords (frayed cords on job sites are an OSHA hazard).
Safety & Procedures
Safety is paramount during slab and foundation rough-in, as this phase involves heavy materials, open excavations, and coordination with multiple trades. Here we list key safety practices and procedures (including any Chicago-specific rules or emphasis):
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): All workers must wear appropriate PPE at all times. Hard hats, safety glasses, and high-visibility vests are mandatory on commercial sites in Chicago. Wear gloves when handling conduits, wire ties, or concrete (to prevent cuts and chemical irritation). Steel-toe boots protect from heavy objects (like dropping a conduit or stepping on rebar). Use hearing protection when using loud tools (cutting or threading conduit). If doing Cadweld exothermic welding for grounding, use a full face shield and gloves rated for high heat, and keep others at a safe distance during the shot. Ensure PPE is in good condition (not damaged).
Trenching and Excavation Safety: Excavations present some of the most severe hazards. Follow OSHA 29 CFR 1926 Subpart P for trenching:
If a trench is 5 ft deep or more, it must have cave-in protection (sloped sides, shoring, or a trench shield box)【30†L37-L40】. For example, in Chicago’s soil (which can be clay), a typical safe slope is 1:1 (45 degrees) if not using a trench box. If space constraints prevent sloping, a trench box or shoring must be used. This is non-negotiable – inspectors (and more importantly, safety of life) demand it.
Ladders or ramps for egress must be provided in trenches ≥ 4 ft deep; a ladder every 25 ft of lateral travel is a rule of thumb【30†L7-L15】. Never jump in or out of a trench – use the ladder.
A competent person (someone who can identify hazards and has authority to correct them) should inspect trenches daily and after rain or disturbances【30†L41-L44】. If water accumulates, pump it out and do not allow workers until the trench is stable.
Keep spoil piles and equipment at least 2 ft back from the trench edge to avoid accidental collapses【30†L15-L23】 (the weight can cause a cave-in).
If working in or around trenches, everyone should be aware of the surroundings – no one stand under a load (like a bucket of dirt swinging overhead), and set up barricades or caution tape to keep others (or vehicles) from falling in.
Chicago has a keen focus on trench safety; expect surprise safety inspections on large jobs. City inspectors can shut work down if trenches are unsafe.
Underground Utility Locates: Before any digging, call 811 or the local utility locate service to mark existing utilities (gas, water, electric, telecom)【23†L59-L67】. In Chicago, this is required by law (Illinois Underground Utility Facilities Damage Prevention Act). Do this well ahead of the work (48-hour notice typically). Once utilities are marked, respect those markings. Hand-dig (with a shovel) within 18 inches of any marked utility to expose it carefully – mechanical excavation shouldn’t be used near known utilities. Many electrical contractors have tales of costly accidents hitting unmarked lines; reduce that risk with due diligence.
Working Around Rebar and Formwork: Rebar projections can be impalement hazards. Whenever possible, cap all exposed rebar ends with rebar caps (those orange plastic mushroom caps or wood trough caps) especially if someone could fall on them. While installing electrical items among rebar, take care with your footing – it’s easy to trip. If walking on formwork, be cautious of openings or penetrations. Use fall protection if working near an exposed edge where one could fall > 6 feet (for example, if you’re on top of a high wall form running a conduit, you need a harness if not protected by guardrails).
Concrete Placement Safety: During the pour, only necessary personnel should be in the area. Wet concrete is caustic – wear rubber gloves and boots if wading in it, and wash off skin immediately if contacted (to avoid cement burns). Beware of the concrete chute or pump hose swing. Hearing protection might be needed if a gas-powered concrete vibrator is running nearby. Keep your hands out of pinch points (between form and screed, etc.). If you need to guide a conduit while concrete is being vibrated, do so carefully, ensuring you maintain balance and have a clear path out. Never stand directly behind a concrete truck or in its blind spot; communicate with the driver if you’re nearby. If using a power trowel or other finishing equipment near your stub-ups, coordinate so you’re not in each other’s way.
Electrical Safety (Lockout/Tagout and Tools): At this phase, generally there aren’t live electrical circuits yet. But ensure any temporary power (like extension cords for tools) is GFCI protected – use GFCI adapters or GFCI outlets (required by OSHA for construction sites). Check cords for damage; don’t use damaged cords. If you need to work on existing electrical (for example tying into an existing service ground or moving an live feeder), follow lockout/tagout procedures – disconnect power, lock breakers, and test for absence of voltage with a multimeter before touching conductors. However, for a new construction foundation, live work is minimal. Most hazards are more construction-related than electrical, ironically, at this stage.
Heavy Lifting and Material Handling: Conduits (especially steel ones of large size) are heavy – a 10′ stick of 4″ RMC can weigh ~100 lbs. Use teamwork or machinery to carry heavy pipes. Utilize dollies or carts for moving multiple pipes. When moving prefab conduit assemblies or long runs, use proper lifting techniques (lift with legs, not back) or mechanical assistance (forklifts, cranes) if available. On a big site, coordinate with the GC’s crane if something heavy must be lowered into a trench (for instance, a big pad-mounted box might be set by a crane). Chicago union worksites often have rules about who operates machinery – electricians typically signal to operators rather than operate excavators or cranes themselves; abide by those safety protocols and only have certified operators run equipment.
Weather Considerations: Chicago weather can be extreme. In winter, cold stress is a concern: dress in layers, take warming breaks, use portable heaters (safely, with ventilation) if needed when doing detailed work like threading pipe. Snow/ice: keep work areas clear – a slip on ice carrying conduit can be dangerous. In summer, heat stress: provide water, rest periods, and shade; watch for signs of heat exhaustion especially if working in a ditch with limited airflow. Thunderstorms: if lightning is in the area, especially with long metal conduit in hand or working in an open excavation, pause work and seek shelter – do not work during lightning storms. High winds: secure loose materials (a flying piece of plywood form or conduit can injure someone).
Chicago Specific Safety Regulations: The City of Chicago may have additional site safety requirements, especially if the work affects the public way. For example, if any trench or conduit run extends into sidewalks or streets, you must have proper barricades, steel plates, signage, and perhaps a permit. Chicago’s Department of Buildings and OSHA often partner in safety enforcement; they will expect compliance with all OSHA standards (no special Chicago electrical safety amendments beyond federal OSHA, but strict enforcement). Also, large jobs often have a Site Safety Plan – electricians should be familiar with it. One local requirement: Chicago sometimes requires a “Public Way Protection Plan” if you’re digging near sidewalks【30†L25-L34】. Ensure any required fencing or scaffolding to protect pedestrians is in place if your underground work is adjacent to public areas.
Housekeeping and Injury Prevention: Good housekeeping is part of safety. Keep the work area free of unnecessary debris – e.g., bits of wire tie ends (they are sharp – pick them up), cut conduit pieces (could trip someone), tools not in use (to avoid trip hazards or being embedded in concrete by mistake!). Cover or fill small holes promptly. After backfilling, make sure ground is compacted and level to prevent twisted ankles. If using form oil or lubricants, clean spills to avoid slick spots. Mark any protruding conduit ends with flagging tape so they’re visible.
Emergency Preparedness: All crew should know the job site address (for calling 911) and the location of the nearest hospital or clinic for any injuries. A first aid kit should be on site and stocked. In event of an accident (e.g., a trench cave-in, someone struck by something), stop work and follow the site emergency plan. Always report near-misses and incidents to the foreman; this helps improve safety. On union commercial jobs in Chicago, there may also be a site safety officer – electricians must cooperate with any safety briefings, toolbox talks, or corrective actions issued.
Remember, no task is so urgent that it cannot be done safely. Foremen and journeymen should lead by example in wearing PPE and following procedures. Apprentices should be encouraged to speak up if they see something unsafe. By adhering to these safety practices, the slab rough-in phase can be completed without injury, setting a safe tone for the rest of the project.
Coordination with Other Trades
Coordinating with other trades is a fundamental part of slab and foundation rough-in. Below are coordination best practices for working around various trades, ensuring smooth progress and preventing conflicts. Each trade interaction includes timing strategies (when to engage them) and key points to address:
General Contractor / Site Supervision:
The GC orchestrates the overall schedule, so maintain close communication with them. Hold coordination meetings specifically about the slab pour schedule. For example, confirm the dates of concrete pours well in advance so you know your drop-dead deadlines for rough-in completion. Request that the GC schedule a pre-pour walk-through with all trades: walk the site with the GC (and structural/plumbing leads) the day before the pour to check that nothing is missing. Also, coordinate inspections through the GC – often they will arrange the city inspector visits, but you need to tell them when you’re ready. Timing strategy: Push to start your underground work as early as possible once the area is accessible, so if you hit unexpected snags (like an unmarked underground obstruction or a missing detail), there’s time to resolve without delaying the pour. If the pour gets delayed, everyone gets unhappy (especially on a large project where a delayed slab can throw off the whole schedule). Staying ahead of the concrete crew is crucial – aim to finish electrical rough-in a day or two before the pour, giving a cushion for inspection and fixes. Keep the GC informed in real-time about progress: e.g., “We finished laying the east wing conduits today, we’ll be ready for inspection tomorrow.” This helps them with sequencing other work (like when backfill can happen).
Excavation Crew / Civil Work:
Coordinate with excavation for trenching and backfilling operations. Best practice: Walk the trench routes with the excavation foreman before they dig, to ensure understanding of depth and width needed. For instance, if you need a 24″ wide trench for a bank of conduits, communicate that – don’t assume they know. Mark the required depth or invert if critical. When the excavators dig, be present to observe – you might catch issues (like a boulder or old foundation encountered) and can adjust conduit routing on the spot if needed. Also, discuss backfill: request that backfilling not occur until you inspect and the inspector signs off. Typically, the excavation crew will backfill once you give an all-clear. Make sure they know if you require specific backfill material (sand around conduits if specified) or if conduit needs special protection (maybe boards over shallow conduits during backfill compaction). Timing: Align your crew’s schedule so that as soon as a section of trench is dug, you’re ready to lay conduit – idle open trenches are a safety hazard and schedule waste. On big jobs, excavation may dig in phases; coordinate to complete each phase’s electrical work in the window provided. For example, they might dig all day Monday, and you lay conduits Monday afternoon/Tuesday, and they backfill Wednesday – set that cadence and verify it with the excavation foreman. Maintain clear communication via daily huddles if needed (“Tomorrow we’ll need the trench from grid 1 to 5 open, then by afternoon you can start backfilling behind us on grid 1-3”).
Concrete / Structural Crew (Rebar and Formwork):
A critical coordination: ensure your conduits and embeds do not conflict with structural elements like rebar, footings, or load paths. Before installation, review structural drawings for rebar spacing and clearance. For example, heavy foundations might have two mats of rebar – you should snake conduits between mats if possible, not displace bars. It’s often useful to physically meet with the rebar foreman: show them where your conduits will run, and they can advise if any bars might need to be moved or if you must adjust the route. Note that any rebar cutting or removal must be approved by the structural engineer – it’s a big no-no to arbitrarily cut rebar to make room for a pipe. Instead, coordinate to have rebar detailing accommodate your larger conduits (sometimes they can shift a bar or use two smaller bars around your pipe if absolutely needed). Many structural engineers allow certain conduit sizes within slabs as long as they’re within the middle third of slab thickness【7†L7-L15】 and not too close to column or footing areas. Get clarity on these limits and stick to them.
During rebar installation: It’s wise to have an electrician on site or on call while rebar is being placed. That way if the ironworkers encounter your conduit and something doesn’t fit, you can collaboratively resolve it (e.g., maybe slightly relocate a conduit or have them move a minor bar with engineer approval).
Grounding coordination: As mentioned earlier, bonding to rebar requires coordination – the ironworkers might even stub out a piece of rebar for you to connect to, if asked. Also, ensure that any embeds or inserts for electrical (like threaded inserts for grounding lugs on equipment pads or building steel connections) are given to the structural crew ahead of time.
Formwork: For wall sleeves or opening blockouts, coordinate with the carpenters setting forms. Provide them the exact type and size of sleeve (and perhaps nailers or brackets to hold it in place) and mark on their formwork where it goes. It helps to physically spray-paint or mark on the forms “ELEC SLEEVE HERE” so it’s not forgotten. Check that forms don’t shift your sleeves during pouring – maybe have someone present to adjust if needed (some crews even nail a small piece of wood across the sleeve inside form to keep it from sliding).
Timing: The rebar installation often happens concurrently with your conduit rough-in. Communicate a plan: e.g., “We will lay conduits in Area B on Wednesday morning, can your rebar crew hold off tying that area until the afternoon?” If electrical is late, rebar may get placed and make your job 10× harder (threading conduit under rebar is tough). Conversely, if you lay conduit early and leave it, the rebar folks need to not kick it around. Best scenario: work together in the same timeframe, section by section. The GC can help sequence: sometimes they let electrical in right after bottom rebar is placed but before top rebar is set, so conduits can be laid then top rebar tied after.
Fireproofing: While not directly in the slab phase, note if any steel that will later be fireproofed needs electrical attachments (like building steel ground lugs, or embedded conduit in a column). Install those before fireproofing. For example, if the spec requires a ground clamp on each column to bond it, doing it now (or at steel erection) is easier than after fireproof spray. Communicate with the fireproofing crew to leave your connection points uncovered or allow you to scrape off a small area to attach lugs (with permission). On foundation jobs, fireproofing isn’t immediate, but plan ahead for it, especially if you have riser conduits going up steel columns – you might need to leave standoffs or guides that will later be beneath fireproofing.
Plumbing and Piping:
Plumbing often has underground drains, sewers, and sumps in the slab, as well as domestic water lines. These are typically large diameter and have specific slopes (1/4″ per foot for sewage etc.), so they can’t just move easily if a conflict arises. Coordination points:
Compare plumbing underground plans with electrical. Identify crossing points or parallel runs. A best practice is to route electrical and plumbing in different horizontal planes if possible: e.g., run electrical conduits deeper (or shallower) than plumbing so that if they cross, one can go under the other with clearance. Many times, plumbing will be deeper because of slope over distance; in such cases, keep your conduits just above or to the side of plumbing lines, maintaining whatever separation is required (there isn’t a strict NEC separation between plumbing and electrical, but practical spacing to allow maintenance – you don’t want a plumber later cutting into a live conduit!).
Communicate with the plumbing foreman: “We have a 3″ PVC feeder running across this bay; where are your 4″ cast iron drains running?” Perhaps you can arrange to put your conduit 2 feet offset to avoid a cross at the same point. If crossing is unavoidable, decide who goes lower/higher. Often, electrical can momentarily dip under a pipe if needed (so long as you maintain required cover and bend radius).
Also coordinate sleeves: if the plumbers are coring a hole through the footing for a pipe, maybe you can share the opening or at least be aware of it. Conversely, if you both need sleeves in close proximity through a wall, cluster them in a planned way rather than Swiss-cheesing the concrete randomly.
Water lines: Metal water pipes entering the building will need bonding – coordinate that the plumber leaves you accessible pipe (usually after the meter inside). Also, avoid running conduits very close to hot water lines to prevent heat issues with your wiring later.
Scheduling: Plumbing underground work often happens roughly concurrently or just before electrical. It’s common for plumbing to be slightly ahead (because they have big trenches for sewers). Try to get your conduits in once the plumbers have placed their pipes so you know final positions (no guesswork). On the other hand, if you’re in first, inform them exactly where your stuff is so they don’t inadvertently install a drain right on top of your conduit. Many GCs have an underground coordination drawing nowadays – insist on one if not provided, where all under-slab MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) components are drawn together to scale.
If you foresee a congested area (e.g., a small electrical room with many conduits and also floor drains, sump pit, etc.), have a site meeting with plumbing and HVAC to hash it out. Sometimes slight re-locations (move a floor drain 1 foot over) can allow conduit bends to fit – but only if agreed before concrete.
HVAC / Mechanical Trades:
Mechanical typically has less under-slab work (most HVAC is above grade), but there could be underground storm drain piping, chill water lines, or conduit for control wiring. Large facilities might have underground ductwork or utility tunnels. Coordinate if any:
If there are underground sleeves for future mechanical pipes that you could inadvertently block with conduit – know their locations. Don’t run your conduit through an area reserved for, say, a future chiller piping route.
Fire sprinklers usually don’t go under slab (they drop from above later), so minimal conflict there.
Mechanical equipment pads: ensure you know if any pad in the slab (for heavy equipment) might conflict. For example, a big air handler might have pad that cannot have conduits running through it. Work with mechanical engineer’s drawings to avoid running conduit through mechanical pad areas; if necessary, route around or below.
If the mechanical contractor needs embeds (like duct anchors), coordinate these like any structural embed. It’s more of a GC/structural role, but be aware so you don’t place conduit right where an anchor or penetration will go.
Chilled water or steam lines: If any insulated pipes run under slab, they often require a trench. Ensure your conduits aren’t sharing a space needed for thick insulation around such pipes. If crossing them, maintain enough clearance to not compress insulation.
Fire Alarm / Low Voltage Trades:
Often, low-voltage conduits (for fire alarm, security, telecom) in slab are the responsibility of electrical as well (or coordinated with them). If there are separate low-voltage contractors coming in later, at minimum provide spare conduits or sleeves for them now. Coordination: Confirm with fire alarm designer if any smoke detectors in floor boxes or pull stations in slab that need conduit now. For telecom, if a conduit bank is needed from the utility room out, include it. Essentially, treat them as part of your scope during slab rough-in or ensure those trades inform you of their needs. It’s costly to add conduits later once concrete is placed.
Utility Company (ComEd / Electrical Utility):
Since this project has an 8,000 A service, coordination with the electrical utility (ComEd in Chicago) is huge. Typically, ComEd will specify how many conduits, what size, and route, for the service lateral. Coordination tasks:
Submit site plan to ComEd for service layout approval. They may require a concrete-encased duct bank from the property line to the service equipment. Ensure this is integrated into your plan.
Schedule any inspections by ComEd for the service conduits (they often want to inspect before you backfill the service trench, separate from city inspection).
Reserve spaces for transformer pads, switchgear vaults, etc., and coordinate those foundations with GC and utility. For example, if there is a vault in the sidewalk, coordinate your conduit approach and stub-ups into that vault according to utility standards.
The utility might have specific rules: e.g., “no more than two 90° bends in the service run, and use sweeping bends of 36″ radius” – comply with these. Also, they might specify concrete type (red dye, 3000 psi) for encasement and require reinforcing. All such details need coordination with structural if it ties into building footing or street work (if crossing under public way, permits via CDOT needed which GC usually handles).
Essentially, treat the utility as another trade to coordinate with – hold a meeting if needed with the ComEd planner/inspector on site before installation to ensure everyone agrees on the plan.
Timing Strategies Summary: To stay ahead of the concrete pour, get involved early in prep meetings. Share your timeline with trades: e.g., “Electrical will need 3 days in Area X for conduit; plumbing, please finish by then or work on Area Y while we’re in X.” Use color-coded tape or flags on site to denote different trades’ embeds to avoid confusion (e.g., red flags for electrical conduit stubs, blue for plumbing risers). Daily or weekly coordination meetings on large projects are typical – come prepared with what you did, any issues encountered, and what you need from others. For example: “Our conduit run along gridline A is in, but we hit the plumbing line a bit – we adjusted around it with an extra bend, please note that location.” This transparency helps all trades adjust as needed.
In summary, open communication, joint planning (using combined drawings or BIM if available), and mutual respect between trades are key. Many common pitfalls (like an electrical conduit ending up right through a planned plumbing drain) can be totally avoided with good coordination. A cooperative attitude – being willing to adjust if you’re made aware of others’ needs – will build goodwill. And remember, on a tough city project in Chicago, you’re all in it together to meet the schedule under the watchful eye of inspectors and the GC. Coordination is what turns a potentially chaotic slab rough-in into a smooth, orchestrated success.
Quality Control & Inspections
Quality control (QC) during the slab/foundation rough-in ensures that the installation meets design intent, code requirements, and will stand up to the pour. Inspections (both internal and by authorities) are formal checkpoints to verify this quality. Below are key QC steps, hold points for inspection, and documentation required:
QC Checkpoints & Hold Points:
Pre-Backfill / Pre-Pour Inspection (Official): As mentioned, before any concrete is poured or any trench is backfilled, an AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction) inspection is required. For Chicago, this is a City Electrical Inspector who will check all under-slab conduits and grounding. Typically, this is scheduled when:
All conduits, boxes, and grounding electrodes are in place (and visible).
The conduit trenches are still open (so inspector can measure depth) or forms are open enough to see conduits in slab.
No concrete yet placed (inspector might literally walk in the trenches or look in forms).
What Inspector Checks: They will verify code compliance: correct burial depths (they may use a tape measure – e.g., see 18″ cover for PVC)【29†L247-L255】, proper conduit type (e.g., RMC under slab as required by Chicago – an inspector in Chicago would expect to see metal, not PVC, under a building slab【49†L5-L8】), that all required grounding (Ufer, etc.) is present and properly connected, and that the work matches the approved plans (if plans show 6 conduits to a panel, they want to see 6 conduits stubbed up). They also check that conduits are not damaged and that fittings are correct (concrete tight connectors where needed). Bonding is a big item: metal conduits likely need to be bonded together – the inspector might check that couplings are tight, any bushings with bonding jumpers (if required for concentric knockouts, etc.) are installed. In NEC 2023, for instance, an inspector might specifically reference Section 300.5 for burial and Section 250.50 for the grounding system continuity【32†L129-L137】. In Chicago, they may also reference Title 14E requirements like confirming PVC use only where allowed【5†L179-L187】. After a successful inspection, you’ll get a green tag or sign-off in the city’s inspection log. If there are issues, the inspector will note them (e.g., “depth inadequate for conduit run along west wall – must be 4″ deeper” or “missing bonding jumper on rebar”). You must correct these and call for re-inspection before proceeding.
Electrical Contractor Internal QC: Good foremen implement their own inspections before calling the official one. This includes:
Checking all measurements (are stub-ups at correct coordinates and height).
Ensuring no mistakes like a forgotten conduit or clamp. A common internal QC checklist: “All conduit ends capped? All required conduits installed? Grounding installed and tagged? Bends ≤ 360°? Conduit properly supported? Any plastic conduit not inadvertently used where metal required?”
Use a level to confirm stub-ups are plumb and a tape to confirm spacing (especially if prefabricated bus or gear needs them aligned exactly). It’s easier to adjust now than after concrete.
Conduit Continuity and Damage: For metal conduits, ensure continuity across couplings (usually by visual/tactile check if tight – some might even use an ohmmeter if critical ground paths). For PVC, ensure no sections are cracked or have gaps (look inside if possible or run a fish tape through long runs to feel for obstructions).
Grounding continuity: using a multimeter, you can do a quick continuity check from the rebar stub to a ground rod or between all grounding points. This isn’t an official requirement at this stage, but it verifies your connections. For example, clip one lead to the rebar (Ufer) and another to the ground rod clamp wire – near zero ohms indicates the exothermic weld is good.
Document any QC findings and fix them prior to inspection.
Concrete Placement Oversight (QC during pour): As described, having an electrician present during the pour is a QC measure to catch any movement or issues. They can do minor adjustments in real-time, which is part of quality control (ensuring the quality of final embed locations).
Post-Pour QC: After the concrete cures, do another check:
Are the floor boxes flush and level? (If an adjustment screw moved, fix it now if possible, or mark it for later fix.)
Conduit Stub Integrity: any crushed or deformed stub-ups from the pour? (Occasionally, heavy machinery or concrete pressure can oval a thin-wall conduit – less likely with rigid steel, but if something happened, note it. Small deformities can sometimes be rounded out; major ones might need that stub to be reworked by core drilling and patching later.)
As-Built Survey: For critical feeds like the 8000 A service conduits, consider doing an as-built survey: measure the exact locations and elevations of the duct bank as installed. In big projects, sometimes an engineer will want to verify that the duct bank has the proper slope or separation. Use a transit to shoot the elevation of conduit at intervals, confirm it’s as per plan (this could be part of QC if specified).
Testing: While insulation resistance tests (megging) are not typically done on empty conduits, some contractors pull a mandrel or test ball through conduits post-pour to ensure no collapse/blockage (especially in long runs or if there was any concern of something falling in). For an important duct bank, pulling a mandrel (a cylindrical piece just slightly smaller than conduit ID) through each conduit ensures nothing inside will obstruct cable pulls later. This is a quality test – if it snags, investigate why (maybe dried concrete inside, etc., which can then be remedied by drilling out or scraping).
If grounding was poured in (Ufer), you can’t test that until the electrical system is connected, but you might do a preliminary ground resistance test on rods or Ufer if curious. Official ground resistance testing might be later under commissioning, but if you have the equipment, measuring now (expect a low ohm reading due to Ufer’s effectiveness) can validate your grounding quality.
Documentation – As-Builts and Logs:
Throughout the process, maintain documentation:
As-Built Drawings: Mark up a set of plans (or use a tablet with BIM software, etc.) with any changes. For example, if you had to route a conduit differently around an obstruction, draw it in. If a stub-up moved 6″ from the plan location due to field adjustment, note that. After the pour, update these with any final measurements. These as-builts will be turned over at project’s end and are vital for maintenance and future renovations.
Inspection Reports: Keep copies of inspection sign-offs (the city inspector’s approved sticker or report). Also keep notes of any corrections you had to do; it shows due diligence.
Concrete Encasement Reports: If you did a duct bank encasement, sometimes the project specs require a compressive strength test of that concrete (since it’s structural to protecting conduits). The testing lab usually handles that via cylinders, but file away the results.
Photographs: Maintain a log of photos taken pre-pour. These can be gold later if someone needs to know “exactly where does that conduit go under the floor?” A picture with a measuring tape or a marked reference can answer it without scanning.
Grounding Tests and Continuity Logs: If you perform any electrical tests (like continuity or ground resistance), log the values, date, and method. For instance, if you do a ground rod resistance test (you might get something like 15 ohms – but combined with Ufer later will drop). Logging it provides a baseline. Some projects require a formal ground system test (e.g., <5 ohm ground) – that usually happens after all grounds are tied together, but if done now, record it.
Material Traceability: Keep records of materials used, especially for critical components. For example, note the batch/lot of the Cadweld shots or clamps in case there’s a future question of a recall or defect. Also note if any coating or treatment was applied (sometimes rebar is epoxy-coated – if you had to grind off coating to make a Ufer connection, note that spot was recoated or not).
Elevation & Location Checks:
As part of QC, especially on foreman level, do location checks:
Stub-up Elevation: If there is a target elevation (say top of conduit stub to be 4″ above finished floor), measure it. If too high, you can cut down later; if too low (below flush) that’s a problem needing immediate addressing (like chiseling out around and adding an extension post-pour).
Conduit Slope for Drainage: For exterior runs, ensure that conduits either slope to handholes or are self-draining. QC check: pour a bit of water and see which way it flows, if practical. Or a level to confirm slope direction. Water accumulation in conduits is undesirable (especially for service later).
Spacing for Thermal Expansion: Check if long straight PVC runs have expansion joints as needed (maybe none needed if encased and stable temperature; but if run across a wide area under slab with potential thermal change before pour, ensure they weren’t locked in a expanded or contracted state – minor point, but part of quality).
Bonding & Grounding Verification:
Before pour, physically verify all required bonds are in place:
Rebar (Ufer) bonded – yes, and wire is accessible.
Building steel bonded – if columns in footing, ensure that connection is made (could be via the rebar tie or a dedicated jumper).
If the spec required a test well for the ground rod (some large jobs put one ground rod in a handhole for testing), check it’s installed at correct location.
Metal conduit is properly bonded: e.g., if using PVC for most but then transitioning to RMC sweeps into equipment, ensure the RMC is bonded to the grounding system (via bushings with bonding screws or jumpers if concentric knockouts – though those will come later with equipment termination).
In Chicago, since metal conduit is prevalent, the focus is that all those metal parts are electrically continuous. NEC 250.96 and Chicago code require any non-continuous metal (like isolated stub or a piece of rebar sticking out) be bonded. QC should catch if, say, a short piece of RMC was used as a sleeve and not bonded – you might need to bond it or use plastic if it’s truly just a sleeve.
Inspection Documentation (Turnover): At the end of the foundation rough, compile the documents:
Signed inspection approval for underground.
A letter or report if any special inspection was required (sometimes structural engineers require an inspection of the Ufer ground connection as part of structural special inspections).
Photos of critical items before covering (especially for things that will never be seen again).
These go into the project’s QC file or commissioning file. They also can be used in the foreman’s report to the company – valuable for institutional knowledge (for example, note if inspector had a particular interpretation of code that might affect future jobs).
In essence, quality control in this phase is about “measure twice (or thrice), pour once.” Every conduit and grounding element should be verified in correct position and properly installed, because once the concrete is placed or trench filled, fixes become exponentially more difficult. The inspection process is there to enforce that discipline – use it to your advantage by being ready and thorough. A veteran foreman will treat the inspector as a second set of eyes to catch anything missed. By diligently following QC steps and documenting the work, you ensure a robust installation that will serve the project without issues when it comes time to energize the system.
Code References
This section compiles relevant code references from the 2023 National Electrical Code (NEC) and Chicago Electrical Code (Title 14E) that apply to slab and foundation rough-in. Where possible, specific code sections are cited to reinforce the requirements discussed above:
NEC Article 300 – General Wiring Methods:
NEC 300.5 Underground Requirements: This is the key section for depth of cover and protection of conduits under earth or concrete. Table 300.5 in the 2023 NEC specifies minimum cover for raceways by type and location【29†L247-L255】. For example, it requires 18 inches of cover for nonmetallic raceways (PVC) in “all locations not specified” (general earth burial) and 6 inches cover for rigid metal conduit in the same conditions【29†L247-L255】. It also notes that if under a building, in a raceway, the cover can be 0 (because the slab itself provides protection)【29†L249-L257】. There’s also a provision for installations under 2″ of concrete beneath a slab (like in a trench with a concrete cap); in such a case cover can be less – e.g., PVC only 12″ if under 2″ concrete in a parking area【29†L251-L259】. Practical takeaway: We followed these rules by keeping PVC at least 18″ deep outside, using RMC under slab (cover handled by concrete), etc.
NEC 300.5(D)(3) Warning Ribbon: NEC mandates that for any service conductors buried ≥18″ deep, a warning ribbon identifying electrical line must be placed in the trench 12″ above the conduits【23†L85-L93】. We have complied by including warning tape above our main service duct bank.
NEC 300.5(E) Backfill: Requires backfill material to not damage the raceway (no large rocks or debris directly on conduit). We noted using sand padding as best practice. Also 300.5(F) on protection: if a conduit emerges from grade it needs rigid metal or other protection to 18″ above grade – relevant for where our PVC transitions to above ground at building wall (we used RMC 90s).
NEC 300.6 & 300.10 Corrosion Protection and Bonding: Metal in concrete or in earth must be protected from corrosion – galvanized RMC is inherently protected, threadless connectors in concrete must be concrete-tight【20†L75-L83】. Also all metal raceways must be electrically continuous and bonded (using proper couplings, bushings)【20†L75-L83】. We ensured RMC threads are tight and likely will add bonding jumpers where needed at terminations (e.g., locknut-bushing combos with bonding screws).
NEC 300.4 Protection Against Physical Damage: Not directly cited earlier, but for example, 300.4 mandates PVC or other raceways passing through a slab or footing should have protection if needed to prevent damage from expansion/contraction or sharp edges. We provided sleeves where needed.
NEC Article 250 – Grounding and Bonding:
NEC 250.50 Grounding Electrode System: Requires that all available grounding electrodes (building steel, metal water pipe, concrete-encased electrode, ground ring, etc.) at a building be bonded together to form one system【32†L129-L137】. This is why we had to use the concrete-encased rebar (Ufer ground) – it was present, so we must include it. The code has an exception for existing buildings, but in new construction like ours, no exceptions – we incorporated the Ufer.
NEC 250.52(A)(3) Concrete-Encased Electrode (Ufer): Defines a concrete-encased electrode as at least 20 ft of ½″ rebar (or larger) or 20 ft of #4 AWG copper encased in ≥2″ of concrete and in contact with earth【32†L111-L119】. We met this by using foundation rebar. It also clarifies it can be in one or multiple pieces tied together (so long as electrically continuous)【3†L67-L75】【3†L75-L82】. We used the usual method of tying the rebar with steel wire, which counts as continuous, plus our bonding conductor to it.
NEC 250.64 & 250.66 Grounding Electrode Conductor sizing/installation: Our GEC from the rebar to the service needs to be sized per 250.66 based on service conductor size, and it must be unspliced or spliced only by irreversible means and protected if exposed. This will come into play when we actually connect the GEC to the rebar stub (likely #3/0 or 4/0 copper for an 8000 A service feeder). 250.64(C) would allow us to exothermically weld that GEC to rebar or use listed clamp (we did clamp/weld at the rebar, effectively making the rebar part of GES).
NEC 250.104 Bonding of Piping and Structural Metal: Requires metal water piping and structural steel that are likely to become energized to be bonded to the GES. We planned for bonding to structural steel (which is inherently bonded via the Ufer if rebar connects to column, but we’ll also run a bonding jumper to building steel near service as a best practice). Also any outside gas or water lines will be bonded as required when they enter (likely later, inside).
NEC 250.8 Connection methods: Requires that bonding and grounding connections be made with listed clamps, lugs, weld, etc., not just a twist of wire. We adhered by using proper UL-listed clamps for rebar/pipe (e.g., acorn clamps on rods).
NEC Chapter 3 – Wiring Methods Specifics:
NEC 344 (Rigid Metal Conduit) & EMT 358 & PVC 352: Each article has “Uses Permitted” and “Uses Not Permitted.” For example:
RMC (344) is permitted in all structural concrete and underground installs. We used RMC accordingly.
PVC (352) NEC allows underground, and even above ground in some cases, but we cross-check Chicago amendments below for local restrictions. One key NEC bit: NEC 352.10 and 352.12 outline where PVC can be used. NEC 352.12 prohibits PVC in hazardous locations, where exposed to physical damage unless Schedule 80, etc. Not an issue here, but noted. Chicago’s amendment to 352.10 we have below.
EMT (358) is not permitted in direct burial per NEC (it would corrode unless specially coated).
Bend Limits: NEC 344.24, 352.24, 358.24 each basically say: bends must not damage the conduit and must have minimum radius per Table 2, Chapter 9. That table gives specific radii; e.g., for 1″ PVC the min radius is about 9.5″, for 4″ PVC it’s much larger, etc. Also the total bends between pull points ≤ 360° (this rule appears in 344.26, 352.26, etc.)【21†L1-L4】. We followed this by limiting bends and planning pull points if needed.
NEC Article 314 – Boxes: All boxes used in slab must adhere to box fill rules and be listed for the purpose. For example, if a junction box is buried in concrete (which is allowed if accessible afterward by cover), it must be designed so concrete cannot leak into it. NEC 314.15 requires boxes in damp/wet locations to be suitable for such (concrete in contact with earth is a damp/wet location)【20†L77-L84】. We complied by using concrete-tight FS boxes for floor receptacles and by sealing all box openings during the pour.
NEC Article 230 – Services (High-Level): The service conduits we installed must meet service lateral requirements. NEC 230 doesn’t explicitly dictate raceway type underground (defaults to Chapter 3 methods), but it does require, for instance, that each service conductor set have overload protection and possibly ground-fault protection at high amperages (for 8000 A, GFPE is definitely required at the service disconnect per NEC 230.95). These come into play later, but upstream, our installation of multiple conduits is in line with NEC 230.2 (one service unless multiple allowed) – we are running parallel conduits as one service drop. We will ensure all service raceways are bonded together at the service equipment (NEC 250.94 and 250.80 require bonding of metal enclosures and raceways for service).
Chicago Electrical Code (Title 14E) Amendments: The Chicago Electrical Code is based on an earlier edition of the NEC (2017 NEC with Chicago amendments, as of 2022; an update to align with 2020/2023 NEC may be in effect by 2025). Key Chicago-specific requirements include:
Metallic Raceways Mandate: Chicago generally requires metallic raceways for most installations. In particular, PVC conduit use is restricted. Title 14E-3-352 (Modifications to NEC 352) permits PVC only in certain conditions: corrosive environments, cinder fill, underground (direct burial or encased), etc.【5†L179-L187】. It then states PVC is not permitted in other cases【5†L197-L201】. Practically, this means Chicago forbids PVC for typical above-ground work and even under slab within a building unless encased or specifically allowed. That’s why our design uses galvanized RMC under the building slab (standard practice confirmed by Chicago specs: “Under Slab on Grade: Use galvanized steel rigid metal conduit”【49†L5-L8】). We only use PVC for the exterior duct bank where direct burial is allowed by Chicago code (and even there, encasement is used for strength).
Concrete Encasement Requirements: While Chicago code allows direct-burial PVC【5†L181-L187】, many Chicago-engineered jobs still call for concrete-encased duct banks for critical feeders (like our 8000 A service) as an engineering practice. In some cases, Chicago code or ComEd standards effectively require encasement for service conduits in the public way or near foundations for protection – we adhered to this by encasing the main service conduits in concrete.
No NM or ENT, etc.: (Not directly our scenario, but noteworthy) Chicago prohibits non-metallic sheathed cable (NM/BX) and often ENT (smurf tube) in commercial work. Everything must be in conduit. So even minor things like a short run to a floor box had to be in conduit, which we’ve done (no flexible plastic raceways allowed).
Grounding and Bonding: Chicago follows NEC 250 with a few enhancements. For instance, historically Chicago required all grounding electrode conductors to be copper (no aluminum GECs even if NEC might allow in some cases) – we automatically use copper for all GECs. Chicago also emphasizes bonding of metal conduits – effectively the same as NEC but enforced strictly. In older Chicago code, the concrete-encased electrode (Ufer) was sometimes not recognized alone, and code mandated supplemental electrodes (which we have provided in the form of ground rods). Title 14E also requires bonding metal water services as in NEC. One difference: Chicago might not allow the structural steel to serve solely as the grounding electrode (some jurisdictions let building steel be an electrode if grounded by footing, etc., but Chicago tends to still require the rebar Ufer even if building steel is present).
Miscellaneous Chicago Specs: Chicago amendments often specify using threaded rigid or IMC for any underground work in or below concrete slabs on grade (which we followed) and using expansion fittings on long runs that cross building expansion joints (something to keep in mind if our slab has expansion joints – we’d need bonding jumpers across any expansion fitting as per NEC 250.98 too). Also, Chicago requires an equipment grounding conductor in flexible metal conduits (so if any were used, we’d include a green wire).
NEC Article 408 and 409 – Panelboards/Switchgear (future connection): While not directly part of our rough-in, it’s worth noting codes that will come into play due to our groundwork: NEC 408.3 requires phase arrangement and identification – when we bring those 8 sets of service conductors up later, we must keep them grouped per phase in raceways and properly identify (we planned parallel conduits accordingly). Also NEC 409 or 110 might require working space around equipment – we placed stub-ups so that later equipment will have correct clearances (e.g., not coming up under where a future transformer neutrals might conflict with anything).
In summary, our slab rough-in complies with NEC 2023 provisions on burial depth, conduit bends, and grounding electrodes, as evidenced by specific sections (e.g., NEC 300.5 for 18″ cover【29†L247-L255】, NEC 250.52(A)(3) for the Ufer ground【32†L111-L119】, NEC 250.50 requiring its use【32†L129-L137】, and the 360° bend rule【21†L1-L4】 which we respected). Furthermore, we adhered to Chicago’s Electrical Code amendments, notably using rigid metal conduit under-slab as required【49†L5-L8】 and limiting PVC to permissible underground use【5†L179-L187】. By following these codes and standards, the installation should readily pass inspection and function safely.
Labor Data
Planning and tracking labor for slab and foundation rough-in is important for training electricians (especially future foremen) to understand productivity. Below, we present typical NECA (National Electrical Contractors Association) Manual of Labor Units data for tasks relevant to this phase, along with notes on adjustment factors. Labor units are given in hours for a standard crew under “normal” conditions as defined by NECA (baseline 8-hour workday, moderate complexity). Baseline Labor Units (NECA Average, “Normal” conditions):
Installation Item	NECA Labor Unit (Hours)	Unit
3/4″ PVC conduit in trench (direct burial)	2.5 hours per 100 feet	(0.025 hr/ft)
4″ PVC conduit in trench (direct burial)	5.0 hours per 100 feet	(0.05 hr/ft)
4″ PVC conduit, concrete-encased duct bank	8.0 hours per 100 feet	(0.08 hr/ft) – extra time for spacers & pouring encasement
3/4″ Rigid Metal Conduit (RMC) in slab	4.0 hours per 100 feet	(0.04 hr/ft) – includes threading & couplings
2″ RMC in slab or trench	6.0 hours per 100 feet	(0.06 hr/ft) – larger size increases difficulty
90° Factory Elbow for 4″ conduit	0.2 hours each	(12 minutes each) – minimal labor to install prefab elbow
Field Bend (large conduit w/ hydraulic bender)	0.5 hours each	(30 minutes each) – time to set up and make a precise bend
Set and secure standard floor box	0.5 hours each	includes leveling in formwork
Large concrete-tight floor box assembly	1.5 hours each	multi-piece floor box with adjustments
Install ground rod (drive and clamp)	1.0 hour each	one rod 3/4″×10′, with one thermoweld or clamp【40†L213-L221】
Exothermic weld on rebar or rod	0.2 hours each	one Cadweld shot (prep and execute)
Connect ground wire to rebar (with clamp)	0.2 hours each	using UL listed rebar clamp (if not Cadwelded)
Bonding jumper to building steel	0.5 hours each	drill/tap hole for lug, attach jumper (if required at footing)
Coordination/meeting time (underground phase)	~0.5 hour per 1000 sq ft of slab	(planning overhead distributed)
(The above are illustrative labor units. Actual NECA MLU values might differ slightly; for instance, NECA might list 3/4″ PVC at 0.03 hr/ft. We’ve rounded for ease. Always refer to the latest NECA Manual for precise figures.) From the above, you can see for example: installing 100 feet of 3/4″ PVC in an open trench might take about 2.5 hours for a crew under ideal conditions. Larger conduit or more complex installs (like encased duct banks) take more time due to handling, alignment, and pouring concrete. Labor Adjustment Factors: NECA labor units are based on “Normal” conditions. On real job sites, many factors can raise or lower productivity. NECA provides guidance for adjusting labor units under “Difficult” or “Very Difficult” job conditions【34†L127-L135】. Key factors and their typical impacts:
Height / Elevation: Work at higher elevations slows productivity. NECA suggests adding about 5% more labor for work over 10 ft high, and 10% more for work 16–20 ft high【36†L169-L177】 (since moving materials and working on ladders/lifts takes extra time). In our slab phase, most work is at ground level, so height wasn’t an issue except perhaps climbing in and out of trenches. But later, for vertical risers, this will matter.
Congestion / Accessibility: If multiple trades are crowded in the same area or if the site is tight (lots of material in the way), productivity drops. Stacks of materials and threading through rebar can slow you down. Estimators often apply a labor factor of 1.1 (10% add) for moderately congested areas and up to 1.5 (50% add) for extremely tight or occupied areas【42†L443-L451】. Our case: working around dense rebar mats is a form of congestion – tying a conduit in a congested rebar cage is harder than an open trench, so that part of work might be “Difficult” category. Also, since we coordinated well, we tried to mitigate congestion, but realistically, slab work with other trades around has some inefficiency.
Weather Impact: Extreme cold, heat, or rain can greatly reduce productivity. Cold fingers thread pipe slower; muddy trenches are harder to work in. NECA doesn’t give one number for weather, but experience does: below freezing, expect maybe 20% loss in efficiency due to extra layers, warming up tools, etc. Hot weather similarly can cause more breaks. We planned winter work accommodations, but any such impact should be added to labor estimates if relevant.
Overtime / Multiple Shifts: Working beyond normal hours leads to fatigue. NECA data (and studies) show that 10-hour days, 5 days a week, over several weeks can cause a 15–20% productivity loss【12†L150-L158】. If you push to 7 days or 12-hour shifts, losses mount rapidly (30–40% or more)【12†L150-L158】. So if our schedule forced lots of overtime to hit the pour date, actual hours spent might exceed estimated hours. For training, apprentices should know: a job done on second shift or with lots of overtime will take more total hours than the same job done with fresh workers on normal shifts. For example, if we suddenly had to double shift to meet schedule, we’d factor that in (perhaps needing 1.2× the labor).
Crew Skill Level: NECA units assume a trained, average crew. If the crew is green (apprentices learning), productivity might be less. Conversely, a very experienced crew with good prefab could beat NECA units. As a foreman, recognize your crew’s capability and adjust expectations. (This isn’t a formal factor in NECA tables, but it’s part of knowing your company’s “factor” as EC&M article notes【34†L93-L101】【34†L119-L127】.)
Site Layout / Logistics: Large sites mean more travel time (getting material from one end to another, or walking 500 ft to a gang box). As EC&M Magazine notes, if material storage is far, consider that lost time【10†L90-L98】【10†L109-L117】. On our project, the slab area is large; we mitigated by staging conduit near work areas, but still there’s overhead in moving around. NECA might not directly quantify this, but an estimator might add a few percent for “job size/area” if it’s huge.
Duplication / Repetition: On the flip side, doing repetitive work can improve productivity. NECA calls this the “duplication factor” – e.g., installing 10 identical conduits in parallel is faster per conduit than doing one alone【36†L197-L205】. We had parallel runs (eight 4″ conduits for service); the crew likely got into a rhythm, possibly reducing labor per conduit slightly. Estimators may apply a discount for such situations in the “Normal” column.
Shift Timing: If work had to be done off-hours (night shift), labor rates might be higher and productivity lower due to challenges at night (lighting, fatigue). This could be maybe a 10-15% hit for night work even before overtime fatigue.
Seasonal Conditions: In Chicago, digging in winter (frozen ground) is slower – you’d factor that in (perhaps via equipment and labor adjustments).
Labor Unit Examples Applied:
Using baseline units, if we have, say, 300 ft of 4″ PVC duct bank encased (which we did for service), base labor = 3 × 8.0 = 24 hours. Now adjust for difficulty: it was congested (working in a trench with multiple conduits – moderate difficulty +20%), and weather was cold (+10%), and the crew did some overtime (+10%). Combined factor might be roughly 1.4. So actual might be ~34 hours for that task. This illustrates to trainees how raw units translate to job reality. Also, NECA classifies projects by difficulty: a simple one-story store might use “Normal” column, whereas a hospital might be “Difficult” (x1.15 or more), and an industrial foundry “Very Difficult” (maybe x1.3). Given an 8000 A service high-rise is a complex project, a lot of our work might fall in at least “Difficult” category overall. NECA Manual of Labor Units Usage: It’s worth noting NECA labor units already include typical inefficiencies (tool setup, moving materials, etc.) in the base number【34†L97-L105】. They assume a certain level of productivity that a reasonably organized crew can achieve. It’s the foreman’s job to either achieve or better those units by good planning, or to know when factors will prevent that and communicate/estimate accordingly. In summary, understanding these labor units and factors helps a foreman plan crew size and duration for the slab rough-in. For instance, if you calculate 1000 labor-hours for the underground phase and you have a 4-week window, you know you need about 250 hours/week. With a single shift, that might be ~7 workers (at ~36 hours/week each allowing some contingency). If conditions are very difficult, you either allocate more hours (more people or more days) or accept that it will take longer. Tracking actual hours against these units during the project is also a great learning tool – it can highlight where productivity was gained or lost (maybe our crew only used 20 hours for that duct bank, meaning 120% efficiency, great – or maybe it took 40, meaning we struggled). Labor data is not just an estimating tool but a feedback mechanism to improve future performance. An apprentice trained with this knowledge will better appreciate the impact of job conditions on how long a task takes, and a journeyman stepping into a foreman role will be able to bid and manage work more effectively, keeping both the project on schedule and labor on budget【34†L95-L104】【34†L121-L128】.
Common Pitfalls and Best Practices
Even the best plans can go awry without experience. Here we compile common pitfalls (drawn from veteran foremen’s lessons learned) encountered during slab and foundation rough-in, along with best practices to avoid them. Paying attention to these can save time, money, and massive headaches:
Pitfall: Inaccurate Layout or Mis-measurement. One of the costliest mistakes is getting a conduit stub-up in the wrong location – even by inches. For example, a conduit for a column light that ends up 18″ off-center in the slab【15†L88-L96】 may require core drilling and patching to fix. Best Practice: Double- and triple-check layout measurements from reliable reference points (grid lines or known offsets). Use surveyors or a total station for critical stub-ups. Have a second person verify key measurements as a QA step. Before the pour, do a walk-through with the drawings in hand, verifying each conduit emergence against the plan. If a mistake is caught when conduits are still exposed, it’s far easier to remedy than after concrete. Mark stub-ups with identifying tags (e.g., “Panel X” or circuit numbers) – this both confirms you have all required stubs and helps avoid confusion if multiple conduits are close together.
Pitfall: Conduits Floating or Shifting During Pour. An unsecured PVC conduit can literally float up in wet concrete, ruining your elevations, and a rigid conduit can get knocked out of alignment by a careless step. Best Practice: Secure conduits firmly. Tie conduits to rebar at regular intervals (plastic zip ties or wire for PVC, tie wire for steel conduit). For conduits in trenches, stake them or weigh them down before backfill. During the pour, assign someone to monitor critical areas (as we did). Also, cap all conduits and boxes – an uncapped conduit can fill with concrete, which is almost impossible to clean out later (leading to chipping or re-pulling that run entirely). We had all ends taped; it’s a simple step that prevents a major pitfall. After the pour, re-check that none of the stubs moved – better to notice immediately and possibly adjust while concrete is green.
Pitfall: Omitting Required Grounding/Bonding Components. It’s easy to forget something that’s not on the main electrical drawings – e.g., the building steel bond or the Ufer ground connection – especially since it might appear on a detail page or note. Missing a grounding component can fail an inspection or, worse, require costly retrofits (imagine having to drill into a foundation later to bond rebar because the Ufer was missed). Best Practice: Use a pre-pour checklist that includes all grounding elements. Cross-check the single-line diagram and specs for grounding requirements against what’s been installed. Also, engage the structural team: remind them and yourself that the rebar is part of the electrical system (NEC 250.50’s mandate)【32†L129-L137】. Mark the location of the rebar connection with spray paint on the form or a flag so it’s not forgotten. Some foremen have the practice “No pour without me personally verifying the Ufer connection.” We followed that: the foreman (or QC lead) physically inspected the Ufer clamp and ground wire continuity just before the inspector did. Redundancy here is good.
Pitfall: Too Many Bends or Difficult Cable Pulls Later. A rough-in might look fine until months later when the wire pull happens and cables get stuck because of an excessive bend or an unnoticed kink. NEC limits 360° of bends between pull points【21†L1-L4】 for a reason – more than that makes pulling very hard. Best Practice: Plan conduit routes with gentle sweeps and minimal bends. If a run is long or circuitous, design in a pull box or vault even if not explicitly called out – better to ask the engineer if one can be added than to struggle or damage wire later. Use long-radius elbows for any feeder conduit – it greatly eases pulling (and is required by many specs for big feeders). Ensure that field bends are smooth; if you crimp a pipe even slightly, redo it – a flat spot inside conduit can scrape insulation. We had one spot with multiple offsets; we combined them into one smooth sweep to stay within the 360° rule and improve pullability. Additionally, clear the conduits after pour – run a mandrel or at least a tape through to ensure no obstructions remain. This proactive step can catch a problem (like a bit of concrete or a deformity) while you still have time to address it.
Pitfall: Lack of Coordination Leading to Clashes. The horror story: on pour day, discovering the plumbing crew’s main drain is directly where you ran a bank of conduits – someone has to cut or redo something, and neither trade is happy. Or a large piece of rebar had to be cut (violating structural integrity) because an electrical conduit was placed without coordination. Best Practice: We emphasized coordination in our plan – and it truly is key. Hold coordination meetings and use composite drawings of all underground utilities. Physically walk the site with other trades. If a conflict is spotted, be flexible and solution-oriented: work out who can adjust. Often electrical conduit can move a bit easier than a gravity sewer line, so we might reroute around if needed (maintaining code compliance). Also coordinate scheduling: e.g., let plumbing get their big pipes in, then we snake our conduits around them (or vice versa depending on situation). Good coordination avoids the pitfall of rework – it is far cheaper to relocate a conduit on paper or in an open trench than to jackhammer hardened concrete to fix an omission.
Pitfall: Poor Backfilling or Concrete Consolidation around Conduits. This can cause problems like settled trenches (a safety hazard and future issue) or conduits that aren’t properly protected. Best Practice: Ensure backfill is done in layers and compacted【30†L15-L23】 – if the GC’s laborers do it, supervise closely. Improper backfill can lead to conduits being exposed by soil settling or slabs cracking if support under them wasn’t solid. For concrete encased ducts, vibrate the concrete around conduits to eliminate voids. We monitored the duct bank pour for this. If the spec calls for red dye in concrete or particular strength, verify the right mix is used (sometimes a pitfall is the wrong concrete gets poured – which could affect the conduits if, say, it shrinks excessively). Basically, treat backfilling and encasing as part of the electrical work quality: we have a stake because poorly done, it might lead to repairs we have to handle later.
Pitfall: Failing to Document Changes. During the chaos of slab work, small deviations happen. If they’re not documented, later trades or maintenance might be blindsided. E.g., an underground conduit was moved but the as-built wasn’t updated, and later someone saw-cuts the slab and hits it. Best Practice: Mark up those drawings and keep good notes. Even take measurements from two perpendicular references for each important run and stub (triangulation) and hand that in as part of as-builts. Take photos with a measuring tape visible. This way, years later, an electrician can say “Oh, according to records, there’s a conduit 4′-2″ off column line B; we better avoid that.” We ensured our plan deviations were recorded – that’s an often overlooked but crucial quality step.
Pitfall: Not Planning for Future or “What-ifs.” Maybe the current design shows 4 conduits to a manhole – but what if later they need an extra circuit? If the slab is open now, adding a spare conduit or two costs little, later it’s nearly impossible. Best Practice: Stub in spare conduits in strategic places (with owner/engineer approval). In an 8000 A service scenario, we often install an empty spare conduit alongside mains for future upgrades. We did include at least one spare in our duct bank (it wasn’t hard to do). Another future-proofing best practice: run a empty PVC spare to an open area for potential future use (like EV chargers in the parking lot someday – if you stubbed one now through the footing, you avoid core drilling later). Also, coordinate with low-voltage folks to put in any extra sleeves they might need. Forethought can turn a potential future change from a pitfall into a minor task.
Pitfall: Ignoring Thermal Expansion or Seismic Movement. Large buildings or exterior duct banks can have significant expansion/contraction. If not accounted for, conduits can crack or pull apart. Best Practice: Use expansion fittings where conduit crosses building expansion joints or long straight runs cross a significant distance. In Chicago’s climate, a 100 ft PVC run can change length a good amount between summer and winter. We installed expansion couplings on the long straight exterior run (per NEC and good practice). Also, in seismic design (less of an issue in Chicago, but if it were in a region with seismic considerations), ensure conduits that cross structural breaks have flex or expansion as needed.
Pitfall: Inadequate Communication with the Concrete Crew. Sometimes, electrical will do everything right, but during the concrete pour, a finisher might yank a conduit that was “in his way” not realizing its importance, or might finish concrete higher than a box top. Best Practice: Communicate clearly with the concrete foreman and crew. Before pour, point out: “These conduits need to remain where they are – please don’t adjust them. Those flags mark box locations – please finish around them carefully.” Perhaps have an electrician present (we did) to work with them. Also, check that the concrete crew knows about any curbs or pad recesses that affect your work (e.g., if they change slab thickness somewhere last-minute, you need to know as it could affect burial depth). Essentially, treat the concrete crew as partners – help them help you, e.g., by marking your stuff visibly and being on site to answer questions during the pour.
Best Practice: Engage in “Lessons Learned” after the pour. A veteran foreman will gather the team and discuss what went well and what didn’t. For instance, if a particular method of securing conduits proved excellent, note it to repeat next time; if a certain tool would have made things easier, get it for next time. Perhaps the team realized that checking layout one extra time prevented a disaster – reinforce that behavior. These discussions turn experiences into improved practices for future projects.
By being aware of these common pitfalls – mislayout, conduit movement, missed grounding, lack of coordination, poor documentation, etc. – and following the paired best practices, electricians can significantly reduce rework and enhance the quality and reliability of the installation. In the words of seasoned electricians: “Plan the work and work the plan – but also have a Plan B.” We applied that: thorough planning, plus contingency conduits and constant verification. For apprentices, internalizing these lessons early will pay dividends throughout their careers; for journeymen stepping up as foremen, enforcing these best practices on their jobs will build their reputation for jobs done right the first time. Finally, remember that every concrete pour “writes in stone” the outcomes of your planning and execution. By avoiding pitfalls and embracing best practices, you ensure that what gets cast into the slab is something you’ll be proud of and not have to chisel out later.
