    "TradeCoordination": [
      "Coordinate with **structural** teams for any needed openings, sleeves, or supports (e.g., ensure floor/wall penetrations for conduits are in place before pulling heavy feeders through).",
      "Work with the **general contractor** on scheduling the pull – large cable reels and pulling equipment may require crane or hoist time and clear access. Schedule the pull during off-hours if it might obstruct other trades (due to long setups or safety concerns).",
      "Coordinate with **mechanical/HVAC and plumbing** to avoid conflicts in congested shafts or ceiling spaces. Ensure your feeder conduits aren’t clashing with ductwork or pipes; adjust scheduling so that space is clear for pulling (no other trade’s materials stored in the way).",
      "Communicate with the **electrical utility** or power company if the feeders connect to a utility transformer or switch – you may need their presence for final connections or shutdowns. The timing of energizing the 1200A service must align with utility schedules and safety protocols.",
      "Ensure **safety coordination**: if using large equipment like tuggers, inform adjacent trades about the operation (no one should step over or near the rope under tension). Barricade the area if necessary during the pull.",
      "Plan with **IBEW crew members** and possibly other subcontractors for assistance – e.g., a carpentry crew might build a temporary&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}need to pull through a tricky elevation change. Also, coordinate any necessary inspection hold-points with the electrical inspector (some inspectors may want to witness critical connections or see that conduit is not yet buried until after inspection)."
    ],
    "CommonPitfalls": [
      "**Underestimating Pull Force:** Large conductors have high friction. Not using enough lubricant or not upsizing conduit can lead to excessive tension, risking insulation damage or a stuck cable. **Solution:** Calculate pulling tension and use a suitable tugger; apply ample lube and consider using larger conduit than minimum code for easier pulling【8†L193-L200】.",
      "**Improper Cond&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:** In parallel runs, mixing up phase conductors (e.g., not having one of each phase in each conduit) causes dangerous overheating due to eddy currents. **Solution:** Meticulously identify and lay out phase A, B, C (and neutral) conductors for each conduit before the pull; use colored tape or tags on ends and double-check phase grouping per NEC 310.10(H).",
      "**Insufficient Coordination:** Starting a pull while other trades are working in the same area can cause interruptions or accidents (e.g., a plumber might inadvertently move a ladder into the path of a cable being pulled). **Solution:** Use a spotter and communicate with all nearby crews; schedule a dedicated time for pulling when the area can be controlled.",
      "**Skipping Trial Runs:** Not verifying that the conduit is clear (free of debris or kinks) can result in a jam halfway through. **Solution:** Always **rod or blow out conduits** with a vacuum or fishtape and pull a test mandrel if possible to ensure no blockages. This is especially important for older conduits or ones that had construction debris.",
      "**Rushing Terminations:** After a tough pull, it’s tempting to quickly land wires. Mistakes like not torquing lugs or omitting anti-oxidant compound on aluminum (if used) can lead to failures. **Solution:** Follow a **termination checklist** – clean conductor, use proper lug, torque wrench to manufacturer spec (NEC 110.14(D) enforcement), and have a second person inspect each termination.",
      "**Forgetting Arc Energy Reduction:** For 1200A services, NEC 240.87/240.67 requires special provisions for arc flash hazard reduction (like settings or a “maintenance mode”). Ignoring this could fail inspection. **Solution:** Work with engineers to ensure any 1200A overcurrent device has an **arc-energy reduction system or documentation** in place【28†L97-L105】, and install labels per 110.16(B) if required."
